Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshipping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.

Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.

Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle.

Oracles are spontaneous casters that use the %^ORANGE%^<master>%^RESET%^ command to learn new spells. They %^ORANGE%^<cast>%^RESET%^ any of spells they learned by expending a spell slot that was prepared using the %^ORANGE%^<prepare>%^RESET%^ command. They can see how many slots per level they have prepared with %^ORANGE%^<recall oracle spells>%^RESET%^. They can list all their available spells for the class with the %^ORANGE%^<spells oracle>%^RESET%^ command.

Oracles get bonus spells from mysteries. To see the available mysteries use %^ORANGE%^<help mysteries>%^RESET%^. They can cast these spells without mastering them.

Oracles can cast in any armor, but they must take the appropriate feats first. They cannot cast while wielding a weapon.
