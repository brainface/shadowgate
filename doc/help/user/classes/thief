Thieves can use nothing heavier than light armor types, as they rely on speed and stealth. Various skills and commands will either take a penalty when wearing metal armor, or will simply not work at all. A high dexterity is very important and useful to thieves.

A major part of a thief's roleplay is interaction with the thieves guilds across the realms. Hidden within cities, they provide additional services, such as fencing and unique combat supplies.

Thieves rely on learning melee feats to expand their options in combat.
