%^ORANGE%^History%^WHITE%^ Maostaphulus was originally nothing more than the favored cat of Silvanus!  They were essentially immortal, but still lived their life -as- a cat! They roamed pretty much everywhere they wanted to, without a care in the world - because even when they fell into rivers, or got lost in trees, they would always just end up taking a nap and when they woke up, they were fine again. Eventually, as new gods were born, and Silvanus's powers waned, Maostaphulus was actually -forgotten- about entirely, until they stumbled into a temple, fell asleep, and ended up being revered as a deity by simple peasants! -Raising- the already immortal feline to godhood.
