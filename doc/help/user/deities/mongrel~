%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^History: %^BLACK%^Long ago, the old gods of death formed a prison to hold the spirits of the departed and keep them from escaping to the living world. To guard the gates, they formed a great and terrible beast, its body made of graveyard dust and ash and gullet filled with the souls of dead animals of every sort, with countless heads to spot any who might pass those grim gates. The gods who made it are long dead, their divine souls passed through the very gates it guards, and now only it remains, keeping its constant vigil and answering the strange prayers of mortals.

%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Regards to Undead: %^BLACK%^Good followers of the Black Dog seek to lead spirits back to the realm of the dead, evil followers might use undead to guard their lairs. The common factor amongst them is control--a well organized army of skeletons can be tolerated, but a group of ghouls on the loose is a problem to solved.

%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Vestments: %^BLACK%^Followers of the Many-headed Mongrel prefer simple dress--their diety is not particularly impressed by opulence. Many priests dress in simple rags, and those needing protection prefer armors of hide, scale, and bone. Weapons are often simple tools--flails, scythes, and shepherd's crooks are common.

%^RED%^Hellhounds: %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^The sole paladin order, Hellhounds follow their omens and visions onto quests to protect common folk from hauntings, possessions, and belligerent undead. They often also enter ill-fated quests to protect the insane, seeing madness as a particular blessing of their god.
