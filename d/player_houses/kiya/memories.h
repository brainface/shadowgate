"%^BOLD%^long dark hair%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^. Somewhere behind them another voice is yelling, calling for them to wait, "
"though none among the three heed the cries. The group of three continue on, still laughing and talking among themselves "

"through %^ORANGE%^towering gates%^MAGENTA%^ and into a great city. Her eyes are wide as she looks around, an expression "
"of mingled awe and curiosity visible upon her face. She trails along behind her companion as they move through the "
"city's streets, slipping out of the way as she passes by the countless people within the city, most human, but some of "
"different heritages. The smells, noises and atmosphere of the city seem to be a lot for the elven woman to take in.\n\n"
"%^MAGENTA%^After a few moments they step into a meeting hall, where another elf is already standing, leaning against "
"the wall. The stranger looks to the two with a welcoming smile as they enter, while the elven woman still seems a little "
"unsure of herself in the surroundings, yet despite her hesitance there is an almost tangible fondness woven into the "
"scene as it unfolds. She looks to the elf across the room from her; he stands slightly taller than herself, with "
"%^ORANGE%^short sable hair%^MAGENTA%^ that rests lightly atop his brow. %^WHITE%^Bright armor%^MAGENTA%^, and even "

"with recognition of the speaker, and begins to speak with the disembodied voice in halting common.\n\n%^MAGENTA%^Her "
"attention drifts from her surrounds, when a sudden roar and the sound of crashing from beside her causes her to turn on "
"her heel in fright, as a wereboar rushes at her and knocks her helpless to the ground, with no spells ready to call upon "
"in her defence. For long moments she struggles simply to stand... only to glance up as a great bolt of %^YELLOW%^li"
"%^WHITE%^g%^YELLOW%^ht%^WHITE%^n%^YELLOW%^in%^WHITE%^g%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^ arcs down upon her from the heavens above, "

"opens her eyes again, looking around in a %^ORANGE%^daze%^MAGENTA%^. As her vision clears, she sees that beside her in "
"the grass is the body of the wereboar that had threatened her life, now quite dead. And raising her eyes, she looks to "
"the figure standing over her - her eyes widen in shock as she takes in %^WHITE%^white hair%^MAGENTA%^ and %^BLACK%^"
"%^BOLD%^ash-grey skin%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^, a half-drow in long robes. His eyes dart immediately to her as he realises "

"%^MAGENTA%^ from sight."
