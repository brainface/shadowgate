4 Harvestdays, 641 SG

Standing in the rear yard behind the Cathedral of
Seneca. Amongst the gardens near the pond. I take
Andoraan's arm and we move along the stone path under
the canopy of the blooming pink dogwoods. Slowly we
move to the gazebo. His armor was buffed to a
wonderful shine and my dress.... 

The perfect dress I worked with the seamstress to
make. I remember being afraid the dress would not be
done in time. The front of the dress was a blue and
golden hand woven silk brocade, which had a fine layer
of transparent ethereal silk georgette flowing over
it. The material covering the breasts was made of a
hand beaded and embroidered blue silk. The gown was
made in a soft blue colored crushed velvet. The sleeves
repeat the same pattern, having puffed georgette over 
the silk brocade, with the transparent georgette 
caressing the rest of the arm.  The dress had a 
graceful, slimming open laced up back was finished 
by delicate lace trimmings. There was an
ethereal detachable silk georgette train. The dress
was decorated with delicate ivory braids, laces and
gold and pearl buttons.

We slowly walked up the stone path and entered the
gazebo. He walked me to where Duncan stood and gave my
hand to him. Duncan looked handsome as always in his
tan shirt and leggings. His grey eyes lit up when he
seen me walk in and the love showed in them. 

As I stood there at his side Lorath began the wedding
ceremony. First he welcomed everyone that joined us
then he asked if anyone had any objections. I
remember thinking as Lorath spoke how a few years
before when I was married to Chance that the man
standing next to me had rescued me from the clutches
of Soulblighter in the temple of Xvim. And how after
I got the twins when I had no one to help me not even
the man I was married to this man whom I had recently
met was willing to help me with them. I remember I
wasn't getting any sleep with them around because they
both seemed to have taken opposite sleeping times. 
After getting to know him more he would take one of
the twins for a few hours so I could sleep. He was so
great with them. Their little faces would just light
up whenever they would see him. Over time he was
always there for me even when my marriage ended with
Chance he was there. He was there to help me try and
pick up the pieces and get my life back on track. I
think he most likely saved my life again. I watch him
and smile and can't help to think to myself what a
wonderful man he has been and how caring and kind. 
And just how much I really love this man. My attention
is turned back to Lorath as he finally begins the
ceremony.

Lorath begins with saying, We are gathered here this
day, to witness the formation of a bond between two
individuals, a bond which is above the strife's of
good and evil, even above the continuance of
neutrality, we have all been granted the wonderful
honor of witnessing the formation of a bond which
represents the final harmony and peace which can only
be achieved through years of faithful duty and hard
work. We are to witness the joining of two hands in
love, the ultimate achievement for two worthy
individuals. 

At this point I remember that a small breeze wafted
through the room, blowing a few of the delicate petals
off of the tree and down the aisle. The room was
filled with light as the sun rose over the small
structure and shined brightly upon the two cherubic
statues. Even though it was raining.

Then Lorath turned to Duncan saying; Duncan, as the
husband of Lea Ironwolf, it is to be your wonderful 
and honorable duty to serve, protect, cherish, and 
love her, in the times of joy, and in the times of 
hardship. Duncan, Faithful Warrior of Torm, do you 
accept this duty?

Duncan of course accepted and then began his vows to
me. He said, Lea, when I watch you and see the one I
love I know that we are meant to be And this is ..
forever And I vow to you I will stand by your side,
through whatever lies ahead of us I will remain true,
so that our love may grow And I will love you, always.

Then Lorath turned to me saying; Lea Ironwolf, as the
wife of Duncan, it is to be your wonderful and
honorable duty to serve, protect, cherish, and love
him, in the times of joy, and in the times of
hardship. Lea Ironwolf, do you accept this duty?

I accepted and then turned to Duncan saying I have
been through many trials in my life. I have also lost
many people in my life that I have cared about. But,
I want you to know that I would endure each of them
again if you it would lead me back to you each time.
For me to stand here at your side and become your
wife. I will love you always.

Without taking my eyes off of Duncan I nod towards
Lorath so he knew I was done. Lorath then said,
Duncan and Lea Ironwolf, may you deliver the final
kiss to complete the seal of Love, which has been
formed here today.

As we kissed two baby sparrows took flight from their
tiny nest in the gazebo, a tad clumsily at first, then
they fluttered towards the us, gliding around
playfully before flying outside.
