I spoke with Hexie and Margath at the teashop in
Tharis today. They were trying to make me feel better
about everything that is going on. And giving me
ideas to help me get Chance back. Hexie told me of a
dream he had and it was rather scary. I think when I
am ready I will write it down and place it in here. 
It got to me, so I am even afraid just to write it
down.

I have decided it was time to write the dream
that Hexie had. The only thing is he did not realize
is that some of this had already happened. I think
that is why it has bothered me so much.

Story as told by Hex

%^GREEN%^Well, Hexie saw Chance. He sittin in bar wif Hexie
like we used too.. He tell me all bout dis
lady...hexie not know her doh. well... We in dere
loong time..it got all dark. Lady comes in and give
Chance hug.. and Hexie got scared.. she stab Chance
in da belly...all da ale and blood in him started ta
fall to da floor. Lady became sad doh...her eyes
changed color and she look HExie. Me just blinked,
cause not know what do...me was strapped in chair. and
daggers no throw good.

Hex nods.

Ya see...da lady started cryin den.. Hexie looked
confused by dis. After a while, Chance stand up again.
He just shake his head at Hexie..and cut me free.
Hexie Stabbed da lady good...in her back and her
nose.. She almost exploded! Den Chance started ta cry
too...Hex never see Chance cry.. so git confused by
dis...Hexie knows people cry for two reasons.. Happy
and sad. Hexie didn't think chance was happy doh, for
he looked weak and sleepy. Hexie got all confused and
Chance starting yelling at Hexie. Hexie started trying
to make da lady drink things to make her better, but
it no work. Chance got angry and told hexie to stab
him too.

Hex thought this kinda odd, and didn't want to kill
chance. Chance attacked Hexie and Hexie ran
away...into the lady hexie just Stabbed and a whole
lotz of people. Everyone else was confused too...and
hexie ran and hid in the shadows. The lady and Chance
spoke for a while again, aldoh no know how da lady
came back, but people come back all the time after I kill
em Chance say he was tired, and didn't want to deal
wif all da pain anymore so Hexie stab him too, release
da hurt. Chance just fell and shook his head at me,
stopping me before I could get him. He told Hexie it
was ok, and he was just getting old and had to learn
more. Hexie shrugged and waved to the army of people
he didn't know. The lady smiled, and threw a bottle at
Hexie, hit me in the head and I woke up
