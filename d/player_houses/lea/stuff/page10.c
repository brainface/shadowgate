After I received the letter I went to where I
left him and Margath was there trying to talk to
Chance. Trying to make him see how much he still
cares about me and Chance was not paying much
attention to it. So Margath tried to prove a point to
Chance and he attacked me then in return Chance
attacked Margath. I was rather surprised and it seems
so was Chance. It just confused him even more. 

I was sitting on the floor where I had been
crying after that and Chance got a strange look in his
eye. He told me to get up when I could pull myself
together. He then started to get undressed. I stood
up slowly wiping away the tears that were still
falling down my cheeks. Margath watched Chance 
rather questioningly and I spoke what was on both of
our minds. I asked him what he was doing. Chance
then asked if I was ready for he knew exactly what I
could do to prove myself to him. I asked what that
would be and he told me to put n my armor and pick up
my swords and kill him. I just stammered out what?
Why? and how will that prove I love you? The look he
gave me sent shivers down my spine for I have never
seen that look in his eyes. Chance said to me "that
from this day forward you will have the memory of what
you did engrained on your brain, my blood will stain
your weapons and the next time you are tempted to so
something, you'll remember exactly what the fuck you
are doing to me." He then dropped to his knees as I
got dressed and picked up my swords. He then closed
his eyes and said to me "after I am dead expect me to
spend a bit of time by myself. But I will try to
forgive you after this" he then let out a long slow
breath as he waited. I remember taking deep ragged
breaths trying to control my tears but to no avail. 
Then I did as he said and. I remember falling
into Margath's arms crying after it was done and
telling him to get me out of there before he returned.

%^BOLD%^%^RED%^ lea...
as for us? i do not know if the future holds an us.... at
least not as it i once thought it did. perhaps in time
i can learn to trust you again, and further down the road,
even forgive you... i can't say i'd hate having the chance
to talk to you alone again, even if it were just mindless
prattle about the weather and idle chit chat through a bunch
of uncomfortable silences....i do miss you, i will not lie
to you, though i'm sure the truth makes a very painful
weapon.... love? i cannot say, i was new to the
concept considering the life i've led and the length
of life i've led... i'd like to think i could love
you again, but that may take time as well.... i have been
lost in a sea of confusion over this.. and margath attacking
you didn't help things any...though you killing me did...again i
am not sure why, for i am lost in all of this as
well...but perhaps it is time to talk...face to
face, and see if we can't sort out a suitable course
of action to please all parties involved...
