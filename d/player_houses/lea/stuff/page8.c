16 Summerstime 636 SG

Today my father left. It all started when I
found him in the street, upset. He asked me if I had
heard and of course I knew exactly what he was talking
about. I told him yes I was the first that Coyotte
and Sera told that they were engaged. I could not
stand the look in his eyes. The hurt and loss and
knowing there was nothing I could do to make it
better. He told me that he was an old man and that
his heart was broken therefore he was broken. He
kissed me on the forehead and told me to be well and
left. I think I finally understand that pain I put
Coyotte through. I felt like someone had ripped my
heart from my chest and stomped on it. I think I was
so in shock when my parents were killed I did not feel
it but this hurt more than I could have ever imagined.
He says he may return but I do not know that for
certain the look in his eyes told me something else
other than what his words said. Perhaps I am just
reading to much into all of this and I could be wrong.
I hope I am wrong.

Gods help me I made a mistake tonight that I
shall regret for the rest of my life..


9 Harvestdays 636 SG

Today my father returned to me. I must say I was
very happy to see him home safe once again. Seems all
my worrying was over nothing. Even though he was
unable to dance with me on my wedding night we danced
in the Rhapsody with Alinbar to accompany us.
