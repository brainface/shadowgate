9 Summerstime, 636 SG

Today was the day of our big wedding. I stood
alone in the Rhapsody, after I got dressed, waiting
for time to slowly pass. My father was unable to make
it to give me away so my brother got the honors. He
presented me with a crown of
%^BOLD%^%^RED%^f%^CYAN%^l%^YELLOW%^o%^WHITE%^w%^BLUE%^e%^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^r%^MAGENTA%^s%^RESET%^.

This represented our parents who died and could not
be there. Margath Is the one who performed this
wedding ceremony on the dock of Shadow. We had
planned on having it on a boat, only we found out his
boat could only hold 10 people. I want to make sure I
try to remember the entire wedding ceremony . 
Margath says: "Friends and adventurers of the land of
Shadow, you're gathered here to witness the wedding of
Chance and Lea Ironwolf... We have seen many things
here, and this is one of the happier moments we'll
have.."

I remember smiling at Chance and he smiling at me.
Margath says: "Chance, Lea, I believe you have your
own vows for each other, each probably well suited to
your own unique character.... I'll ask Lea for hers
first. Lea?"

Then I took Chance's hand in mine and said "Chance, I
love you and you touch all of the places in my heart. 
I want to spend the rest of my life with you by my
side forever and ever."
Then I placed the ring on Chance's finger.
Margath turns to Chance and says: : "Chance, Your
vows?"

Chance took my hand and held it palm up and he said:
"Lea, since the day I first looked into your eyes I
knew there was something special about you. You've
always been a good friend, through good times and bad,
always had a shoulder for me to lean on, and always
wanted nothing more then the simplest of things from
me, and despite my stubbornness and yours you've
always waited for me to feel comfortable with this
before pushing me, and now Lea Ironwolf, I pledge to
you my love and devotion. My blade is yours if ever
you need it, and my heart has been yours for longer
then I can recount, but it too I give to you and
finally....

Chance placed his daggers blade on my hand and wrapped
his hand around the serrated edge

I raise and eyebrow at him a little wondering what he
was going to do.

Chance said: "I give you my blood....." Then he RIPPED
the dagger out cutting both our hands deeply
Chance said: "to mingle with yours and make this union
complete"

He then placed the ring on my finger and said: "I love
you Lea"

Chance held my cut hand tightly in his and Margath
pulled a simple white cloth from his mage robes, and
wrapped our hands in it slowly.

Margath said: : "If anyone here has an objection to
this wedding may they got to bane and discuss it with
him. Lea? Chance? I now pronounce you man and wife
until Tristan is sick of seeing your names on the list
of players in the realms."

Everyone started to cheer and Taaveti spoke up and
wanted to say something. The words he spoke were
these: "I have known you for a short time, but you
both have honored me in much that you do, I consider
you friends till death as well, and I wish all the
best for you till the ends of time."

Margath had one final thing to add before we all went
to the reception at the Rhapsody and it was this: "May
the cloth that symbolically binds you together now,
bind you together in love and happiness for many many
years to come, And may adventure never leave your
lives."

Margath said: "Kiss your wife, you pirate."
Then Chance kissed me.
