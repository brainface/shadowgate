Today I met and interesting gentleman. His name
was Melchior. He asked me to play darts with him. I
must say I was not very good at all, but he taught me
a little. I must say he was very charming.

A few weeks ago I was lost in the dessert in this
new and strange land. I had a friend that I had met
by the name of Marius come searching for me. He had
also had a friend aid him in his search for me. Well
his friend found me first and introduced himself as
Whitefalcon. They took me back to town so I was safe
once again.

Well it seems Whitefalcon was interested in me
after we first met, for he has been spending a lot of
time getting to know me and has told me he was in love
with me. I must admit I have feelings for this man. 
Well today he proposed to me and wants to get married
as soon as we possibly can. We have the wedding date
set for a month from now.

Whitefalcon seems to be having troubles of late
with a bard. They seem to think they have to keep
killing each other. I hope that they will eventually
get along for I do not see the senseless killing they
are doing. I guess we shall see what the future
brings. I pray that the Lady will keep him safe from
harm.
