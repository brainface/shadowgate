Baby is gone

14 Harvestdays, 637 SG

Today I was rescued after being grabbed by
Soulblighter and taken to his temple. I remember
Dread walking into the temple and Soulblighter
attacking him and killing him. Then Armath appeared
from the shadows and I looked to him for help but he
helped Soulblighter instead. Then he came back
shortly after with reinforcements. Melic, Lliira and
a Ranger of Mielikki though I do not remember his
name. Soulblighter had wanted the information I had
that would weaken Kaorewyn enough for him to be
killed. Well my secret is still safe.

Today was the final blow dealt to Kaorewyn. 
Marisela created a box to weaken Kaorewyn so we could
perform a ceremony and rid him from these realms. It
started with the fact that we needed someone, a
warrior, to take him out in a fair battle no magic no
tricks. I asked Coyotte to help and he did. It was a
great battle. We then took Kaorewyn to Selune temple
and performed the ceremony. Then he was buried in the
temple. Taaveti I hope you are still alive someplace
as he had claimed. I will not give up searching for
you.

Today Kindra gave birth to not one but two
babies. A boy, Taaraenor, and girl, Ellana, and she
died within moments of there birth. Margath and
Bryanna were there for her. She sent me a letter
asking me to care for the children as I had promised
Taaveti I would watch over her and them. I was so
angry because this is not fair. How can the gods take
away both of there parents. Taaveti wanted these
children more than anything and he can't enjoy them.
