19 Autumnstime, 633 SG

I realize it has been a long time since I have
written in here. Perhaps I thought since I have my
friends I didn't need to write me feelings and
thoughts down. So much has gone on since that day
this past spring when Whitefalcon and I spilt up. 
Seems Benedict and I have grown closer only for him to
leave me in the end. 

(two folded pieces of paper in between the pages of
the diary)

letter 1 from benedict

%^RED%^ M'lady, I fear I have little time to write
you this message...the voices, they grow stronger
within my head...for the love of Grumbar you have no
idea how strong their beckonings can be... I do not
know how longer I can withstand their urgings...it has
taken nearly all of my willpower to wall them out of
my mind now to write this note to you...to assure
you...or...perhaps to assure us both, for I would be a
liar if I denied that I am fearful of what is
happening to me...what I may become I had heard tale
of a lich...more powerful then any other the entire
realm over, who's evil was matched only by his wisdom
of the arcane arts... It was greed...my age old
enemy...my eternal weakness...my greed is what has
done this to me Vecna...this Arch Lich i spoke of...he
was not chaotic, I did not seek him out for the glory
of Grumbar, I only hoped to glean greater knowledge
for myself by defeating him and searching his
libraries After an epic battle the monster finally
succumbed to death...or so I'd thought... A short time
after I dealt the death blow I began to search his
libraries for the source of his power...this is when i
began to hear the voices...oh that first time they
were such sweat melancholy...enticing, alluring...they
saw my flaw, my greed, and they preyed upon it
%^RED%^They made me forget that what i was doing was
wrong as i cut off the hand of the lich...and in their
sweet whispers they convinced me that all this beast's
power could be mine, only I would use it for the glory
of Grumbar, the spread of order...
%^RED%^ Lea...I pray you do not think me weak for
this...but the voices...they were like a drug, i saw
not the reality of my actions...I felt not the
pain...as I cut off my own hand!! Lea...oh Lea...I cut
off my own hand, and in its place I attached the
gnarled hand of this creature, this beast which has
plagued our realm for centuries Those sweet
voices...those sweet sweet voices which penetrated my
mind and soul, made me feel alive, made me feel as a
hero might...when I attached the twisted, mummified,
old hand...I heard the true voice...and it was
laughing at me...I did not kill Vecna m'lady
%^RED%^ Owe his body might have fallen...but his
soul, it lived on...and now it searches for a new
body...it moves to possess me, force me to do his
will... And he is so strong m'lady, he plagues my
dreams with horrible visages of death and massacre,
while every waking moment he spends tormenting
me...offering me power the likes of which we can not
imagine if i submit to his will, and when i refuse he
might sieze control of my faculties and force his will
upon me anyway Until Vecna has been purged from me
body and soul i do not know what shall come of me, of
my sanity...of my actions At times it is like i watch
myself from outside of my body...a passenger to his
destruction But i do not believe he can totally
destroy me within my own body...I hope...I pray I
shall still be able to contend his actions...and so
m'lady i shall never allow him to injure you...i
simply do not know what else I can promise but
that...for that is the only thing i would willingly
sacrifice my sanity...my very soul to protect
%^RED%^ Gah!! It has been too long...he grows
restless within my mind...he claws at my soul to
escape from the recesses of my mind and once again
come to the forefront of my mind...
Benedict Plunges Into The Blackest Depths of the
Soul%^RESET%^

(letter 2)

%^RED%^The beast, he rises within me still m'lady at
an alarming rate...i do not know how much longer I can
maintain control, or my sanity..i wanted to take this
chance to write to you and tell you how your words
touched my heart I make you this promise m'lady, my
love...if the monster does over come me, and drags my
soul down into the blackest depths of his soul to chew
upon at his leisure...i shall find a way to return to
you.  %^RED%^You quoted my a saying before...you don't know
what you have until you lose it, now i shall quote you
one, love knows no bounds...take these statements as
age old truth, and know in your heart that no matter
what the coming days may bring, i shall
return%^RESET%^
