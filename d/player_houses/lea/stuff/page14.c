Well Chance wants nothing to do with these
children. He won't even look at them. I am not sure
what I am going to do. I know it is going to be very
difficult raising them alone. I love Chance but I
need his support and help though I don't think I am
going to get it. I shall wait until he returns and
speak to him then.

Well today I was surprised by Dread. He and I
have been talking a lot and he has been helping me
with the twins. I probably should have been able to
guess with all the time he had been spending with me
and all the attention he was giving me. He told me
today that he loved me. I admit I was rather shocked
for it is not something I had thought about. I know I
have feelings for him though I am unsure about them. 
I am not sure if they are feelings for someone as just
a friend or are they because I have been lonely
without Chance and just needed someone to talk to and
understand me and what I am going through. It has
been 4 months since I last seen him and the twins are
getting more active and harder to manage on my own. 
Dread has been keeping one of them so I can get a
little sleep now and then. I do not wish to hurt
another and I am unsure what I am going to do. I
guess only time can tell.
