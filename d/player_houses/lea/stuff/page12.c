Well Chance and I met in Kinaro today for a long
talk about us. I was never so nervous in my life. I
walked into the bar and he offered me a seat at his
table. I think we were both rather uncomfortable at
the first meeting after all that has happened. We sat
and talked about everything why it happened and what
had happened. I think it went rather well for we are
going to try and start over again and see if we can
make things work.

16 Sundays 
Margath and Bryanna got married tonight on my
boat with only Chance and I there. It was a nice
ceremony though the clergyman was a bit flighty. I
wish them both the best of luck and it is about damn
time they got married.

I got some interesting news today.. It seems
Chance and I are going to be parents. I am not sure
how he will react to the news. For I know in my heart
this is not something he wants. Though he knows it is
something I wanted. I guess only time will tell how
things will work out.

Well today I found out even more interesting
news. It seems Kaorewyn the Nightcloak of Shar had
something to do with being responsible for the child I
carry. It is mine and Chance's child jut the
Nightcloak claims that he altered it somehow so that I
could conceive this child. I also seen Chance for the
first time today and delivered the news to him. He
was rather upset at the fact that he was going to be a
father. He has told me that he wanted his blood line
to end with him. He did not wish to pass on his genes
to a child. My friends it seems are also turning
against me and the child as well. I am not sure what
I am going to do.
