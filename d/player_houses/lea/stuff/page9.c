Today I broke Chance's heart and lost his trust
in me. I told him tonight of what I did several
months ago. Today is the first I have seen him since
the wedding. I told him of my night with Coyotte. He
was so hurt I am not sure what I am going to do to if
I loose him forever. He was upset and I ran then he
sent me a letter.

{letter}
%^BOLD%^%^RED%^ Well i wasn't planning on you leaving
quite so fast, cause i had a few more things i wanted
to say.... but i guess this will have to do lea, you've broken my
faith in you... a faith that took a long time for me to give, and a
trust that took even longer to build. you've stabbed
me in the back and left me for dead, crying all the
way as you ran from my dying body, looking back to see
the vultures circling and then tried to come back to
scare them away and help, and only made me aware of
what it was you did.....you've destroyed a thing i had belived
in and hoped was true... something i had dreamed might
one day turn my life around and get me headed in the
right direction, marriage..... now it seems that even
a sacred bond, done three times, just to ensure it was
treuly meant to be, is no longer meant to be anything.
if i come around, it'll be on my own terms, and in my own
time, but never again do i think i can be as close with 
you as i once was..... i have a long memory and painful
things tend to brand themselves into my memory.... and
i tend never to forget those things....i hope you find a way to
forgive yourself, or forget.... for i cannot promise i will at
all, or even in some small portion. fair journies to
you lea... i do not wish to see any undue suffereing
on you, but i also do not wish to see you at all... 
your soon to be ex-husband
