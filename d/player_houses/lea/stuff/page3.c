Today is my wedding day. I can't wait to
see Whitefalcon today. I hope he is just as excited
about this day as I am. I must admit I am also very
nervous. I have prayed to my goddess, Mielikki, this
morning that she will bless this marriage and protect
us from those that will harm us.

Yesterday, I went to a friend of Whitefalcon's an
interesting little gnome by the name of Benedict. I
bought a wedding gift for Whitefalcon. I met Benedict
a little while ago and even though he is very friendly
he seems to really enjoy his gold. I really hope that
Whitefalcon likes what I go him.

Well I guess today is not meant to be my wedding
day and my union with Whitefalcon is not to be. It
seems he has found another he is in love with. She is
a ranger that has a husband and seems to be very
giving of herself to others in ways not proper for one
who is married to another.

As I ran from the church in Veribone, I found
myself at the dock crying. I heard this voice ask me
what was wrong. Even though I did not see anyone
there I answered that my fianc just left me for a
married woman. There were two people there and they
were both invisible. The one that spoke to me said
his name was Harmony and his friend was Margath. The
ferries did not seem to want to stop at the dock so
Harmony asked me if I would like a ride back to Shadow
in a boat. So I boarded the boat and then they
appeared once they boarded. Harmony proceeded to tell
me how much better off I would be without Whitefalcon.
Then Harmony tried to set me up with his
friend Margath thought we would make a good match.
Margath started talking about someone named Chance and
how he thought I would be better suited for him. I
am not exactly in the mood to trust another with my
heart.

I ran into Benedict today and told him what was
going on. He seems to be genuinely concerned about me
and said anytime I need a friend or someone to listen
to me he would be there for me.
