10 Winterstime, 646 SG

Well I survived a year with this horrible disease. I
fear this shall be my last entry her into this book. 
Tonight I said my final goodbye to my father and few
remaining friends. I will ask Androkk to spend the
final hours with me. I am growing wear but I know my
heart remains with those I love. Tonight I braided
and cut a lock of my hair and tied it around my
fathers neck so he would always have a piece of me
with him. He told me that as not daughter to father
but as friend to friend that I am loved and will be
missed. I must tell you father if you ever read this
I love you with all my heart. Jidaro, you have been
the world to me and taught me so much about living. 
Long live the Angels. I know there are many who are
happy to see me go and others who are saddened by my
parting. 

Chance, you seem to have disappeared but if you read
this know I never stopped loving you and wore that
rusty old ring till I died in my bed. If my house
gets completed there is a surprise for you there its
in the pantry.

Duncan, I am sorry that last we spoke we fought over
something so childish as my beliefs. You have always
been a good friend.

There are many more I wish to say goodbye to but I
fear I grow tired and weary. All of you know how I
feel about you. Margath and Bryanna I love you both
and many others I already said goodbye to in my own
special ways
