16 Winterstime, 632 SG

I am sitting here in my room at the Inn thinking
about my family and how my brother and I came to this
place. I miss mother and father and feel very homesick
and there doesn't seem to be much that Morgan can do
to cheer me up. Perhaps writing about them here
will help me to feel better.

My parents were truly in love, which is not
always the case with people of my race. My mother,
Elizabeth Lomelino, was a magician, who was part of a
traveling minstrel show. She performed sleight of
hand and minor magic for the delight of peasants and
their children. My father, Krillanthuas Ironwolf, was
a Grey Elf from the far north. A retired Knight of
Mielikki. He was out on a scouting mission,
following orcs. The orcs had traveled quickly across
his lands and he was curious as to where they were
going. He came upon the burned out caravan. He heard
the sounds of soft crying and wondered where they came
from. He searched around and found a petite human
woman huddled in a small corpse of trees. She had
cast a spell to make herself invisible, and had to
watch helplessly while the orcs had slaughtered and
looted the caravan. Searching the ruins, she found
the remains of her spellbook and enough clothing to
last the trip back to Krill's farm. On the trip back,
love blossomed and Morgan, my oldest brother, was born
a short time later.

I was quite the tomboy and was always into mischief. 
My father never really punished me for my
wrong-doings. He had taught me the art of fighting
and would challenge me to a fight when I misbehaved. 
I would take a thorough beating those times. My
mother had taught me sleight of hand, but I didn't
have the patience for magic. My mother had a bubbly
personality and she could never disapprove of me. She
told me that I was much better than Morgan at sleight
of hand, but I could never tell him that. I promptly
did. 

Not long after my younger brother's 13th
birthday, My brother Morgan and I, traveled to the
closest town for market day. We spent most of the day
there, buying needed items and selling produce. 
On the return trip, we passed a slaver caravan. 
We gave each other hard distrustful stares. The
Ironwolfs hated slavers and I could not believe that
my father would allow the slavers to cross our land.
By the time we reached our home, we understood. 
Our house was burnt to the ground. Our parents
murdered and our younger brother missing, we buried
our parents and gathered the few meager possession's
we could salvage from the burnt ruins. Our father
kept a small sack of platinum coins under
the hearthstones (Our mad money, he called it) so we
were not strapped for cash.

At that very moment my brother forsaked
Mielikki. He cursed her name and blamed her for the
death of our parents and the capture of out little
brother. I remember how very angry he was. Was a
very frightening thing.

We tracked the slavers for nearly three weeks. 
When we finally caught up with them, we extracted
revenge for the murder of our parents. Every slaver
in the train was killed and the slaves were released. 
It was quite bloody, the knowledge that those bastards
had killed our parents was enough to keep me going.
The released slaves informed us that our brother,
Dalamaer was sold to a cleric of Xvim heading south to
Shadow. So we decided to head south.

I decided to follow in my father's footsteps and
continue following Mielikki. My brother refused for
he blamed her for the death of our parents. Perhaps
someday he may change his mind and come back.
