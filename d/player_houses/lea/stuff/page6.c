9 Sundays 636 SG

Well today was a very strange day of events for
me. Perhaps I should start back a bit ago. It all
started as an uncomplicated meeting of a friend of
Harmony's. Harmony had told me many stories about a
pirate dwarf named Chance. I was very interested and
the first chance Harmony got he introduced us. I
walked into the Rhapsody, then owned by Harmony and
Rowena, with my friend Tallanvor. There sat Harmony
and Chance at the bar talking. Harmony got this
mischievous grin on his face like he was up to
something and then proceeded to introduce Tally and I.
Well the next thing I know Chance had us all talked
into going on and adventure to a place full of
pirates. Well shortly after we got there I was called
away and had to leave so he was kind enough to take me
back to the dock of Shadow.

I must say that I never expected much to come of
that first meeting, although we had become friends and
had many long talks. Well these talks we had became
more and more frequent and we spent a lot of time
together getting to know each other. Well I guess
this has taken me by surprise and not sure when but I
fell in love with this one-eyed pirate dwarf. Perhaps
it was the day he gave me a kiss for my birthday. 
Life just seemed to keep getting better from there. 
He finally let down his guard enough and told me he
loved me. I think that was one of the happiest days
of my life. Well things seemed to go rather well
until one day a friend of mine professed his love for
me. He was engaged to another at the time and shortly
after broke up with her.

It seems that another has taken interest in me
and wishes my attentions. Well I was very unsure of
my feelings about this new man who wanted my attention
and heart. I then talked to them both and told this
new man I could not be with him for my heart belonged
to Chance. I wish this would have been good news but
it seems Chance and I got into a fight shortly there
after that and things did not go well for he threw the
two emeralds I gave him on the ground in front of me. 
I picked them up and held them close to me. I had
hoped he would come back and get them but he did not. 
A few days later I was in the thieves guild when
he walked in. I must say it was very awkward at
first. He then apologized to me and told me he was
very sorry and I said the same to him. I also
returned his emeralds to him. Well, after a very long
talk about us he proposed marriage to me, and I of
course said yes. We decided we were going to wait
until he was comfortable and ready to get married
before we did. Well today I said goodbye to the other
man to try and make him see that yes I have decided to
be with Chance and although I care about him very much
Chance was the one that had my heart and I would
marry. 

Well Chance decided right then and there he and I
were going to get married. We were married in a very
small ceremony, to my dismay without my father present
to give me away, performed by Amidon and witnessed by
my best friend Margath at the Rhapsody (Tigger
stumbled in at the end). Even though father was
unable to attend I felt his presence very much in the
room. We have decided to have a bigger wedding in the
future for all of our friends and family on a boat in
the middle of the ocean.
