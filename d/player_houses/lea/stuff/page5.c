7 Colddays, 635 SG

I have discovered that perhaps my brother was
right. You can't follow a faith or God just because
your family did. I discovered my heart wasn't into my
faith as it should have been. So instead of following
and hurting myself and slander the name of Mielikki, I
found the best thing for me to do was leave with a
promise. My promise was to always still protect and
watch over the forests as I have always done. I do
not have regrets about leaving perhaps in time I will
find it in my heart to return. 
Something I have found out is that people are
very judgmental. I have found that many of my old
friends were attacked verbally when they tried to
explain my reason behind leaving my faith. That is
was something that had waned and needed to be pruned
back.

Recently I have come to find out some very
shocking information to me. I have discovered that a
friend I have made while in this place was one of the
slaves I set free so long ago on that eventful day. 
He has become like a father to me and I a daughter to
him. There just seems to be a bond between us that no
one seems to understand. For I saved his life and in
return he has saved mine even if he doesn't realize
what he has done for me. This man will always be my
rock and my strength no matter who is in my life. I
hope one day he will realize just how much I love him.
Jidaro, I love you my father and I pray I shall never
disappoint you. If I do please find it in your heart
to forgive your daughter for she does make mistakes.
