4 Harvestdays, 642 SG

Well today has been a year since Duncan and I was
married. This is the first time we have been able to
sneak off alone since we got married. With all the
invasions in shadow with the demon trying to take over
as well as the Empire taking over. We got Ambrosia to
watch the twins for a little while so we could spend
some time alone.

Duncan Alexander was born.

Today Duncan and I had a fight about Karrillian the
paladin of Tyr. This paladin told Duncan he couldn't
leave and that he had to stay and fullfill his duty to
torm. That Torm should come before his family. Well
needless to say I was not happy with him making
decisions for Dread and I or that dread would agree to
anything before speaking with me. Then let that
paladin tell me what we were going to do. After
telling the Paladin what I thought of him I walked out
of the temple to mine and Dread's spot. He found me
there and he agreed his god should come before his
family and shortly after he took off his wedding ring
and dropped it on the ground and walked away.

I got some really bad news today. I visited the
local healer about the fact I was dropping weight so
quickly over the past few weeks. It seems I am sick
and most likely am going to die. There is not much
she or anyone else can do. It seems my body is being
eaten away by tumors. I am not afraid to die and
finally stay dead. But I know how my friends will be
hurt and that is the very last thing I want. I found
myself trying to hurt them anyway I could so they
would be angry with me and not be hurt when I am
finally called for the final death and my judgement in
front of Kelemvor. I think its time I tell them and
Duncan. Even though he and I have been on the outs
since the Paladin of Tyr showed up. I am afraid for
all the people who are going to get hurt by this. But
I will slip away quietly after I have said my personal
good-byes to those that mean the most to me. For
those I do not get to tell goodbye to and if you
happen to read this know that I love and care for you
all and you shall always remain in my heart and I will
always be with you as long as you remember me.
