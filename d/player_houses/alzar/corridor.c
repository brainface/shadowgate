---Corridor---

(This corridor is on the very first floor of the temple, just when you come inside. It leads to the mage lab (Alzars room) and the torture chamber (mine). There is a key, which can be found here upon searching the mummies. That key, the jagged scrap of metal, opens the library and conference room doors. It should also be in the inventory of those who attempt to open the torture chamber. The symbols open the mage labs.)

***Long Describe of Corridor***

%^RESET%^%^RED%^This long, dark corridor opens before you as you step inside, enclosed by walls of oppressive %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^bl%^RESET%^ac%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^k g%^RESET%^ra%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ni%^RESET%^te%^RED%^. The ceiling is rather low, which gives the corridor an almost tunnel-like feel. %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Va%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^r%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^iega%^RESET%^t%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ed t%^RESET%^i%^MAGENTA%^l%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^es%^RESET%^%^RED%^ form the smooth, dark floor beneath your feet. Three menacing mummified %^WHITE%^%^BOLD%^figures%^RESET%^%^RED%^ rest in the alcoves along the corridor, their limbs twisted into strange contortions barely illuminated by the candle %^YELLOW%^fl%^RED%^a%^YELLOW%^mes%^RESET%^%^RED%^ in their otherwise vacant eye-sockets. On the easterly side of the corridor, stands a %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^gr%^RESET%^an%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^it%^RESET%^e %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^door%^RESET%^%^RED%^ with strange %^MAGENTA%^s%^BOLD%^y%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^mb%^BOLD%^o%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^ls%^RED%^ carved into it. The corridor terminates at its southern-most point with a massive %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^bla%^RESET%^%^BLUE%^c%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^k marble door%^RESET%^%^RED%^ inlaid with a single jawless human %^RESET%^sku%^BOLD%^l%^RESET%^l%^RED%^ and a sunburst-design formed of bits of %^RESET%^sh%^BOLD%^a%^RESET%^tter%^BOLD%^e%^RESET%^d %^BOLD%^bones%^RESET%^%^RED%^ sunken into the stone itself.

***Listen***

%^RESET%^%^GREEN%^Your footsteps are somehow muffled on the %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^t%^RESET%^i%^MAGENTA%^l%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ed floor.%^RESET%^

***Smell***
%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^Faint traces of %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^sm%^WHITE%^o%^BLACK%^ke%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^ can be smelled in the musty air.%^RESET%^

Exits: (temple  to temple 1st room) (east  mage labs (has door)) (south  torture chamber (has door))

***Items to look at and what have you***

figures,  mummies :
 %^RESET%^%^RED%^Upon closer inspection it appears that these three shriveled, dusty %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^figures%^RESET%^%^RED%^ are actual remains of the %^CYAN%^dead%^RED%^, mummified through exposure to extreme dryness. What remains of their %^ORANGE%^de%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^s%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^icc%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^a%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^ted flesh%^RED%^ clings to their contorted bodies underneath the %^BLUE%^ta%^MAGENTA%^t%^BLUE%^te%^MAGENTA%^r%^BLUE%^ed rags%^RED%^ which were once the corpses' burial shrouds. An %^MAGENTA%^eerie%^RED%^ light dances within their eye-sockets from the %^BOLD%^fl%^YELLOW%^a%^RED%^mes%^RESET%^%^RED%^ of small %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^black candles%^RESET%^%^RED%^ endlessly burning within them.%^RESET%^

*Notes on mummies, figures*
[search mummies/search figures --> gives the message, "%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^which one?%^RESET%^" = search mummy 1, search mummy 2, search mummy 3, upon searching all of them get room message  ?

"%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^Part of the the %^ORANGE%^de%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^s%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^icc%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^a%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^ted remains disintigrate, leaving behind crumbled fragments and %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^gray dust%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^ in NAME's hands.%^RESET%^" 


[Searching the figures/mummies will always yield an item to pop into inventory or ground = either a scrap of metal or a bone fragment]

key, scrap : (item - short describe)
%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^ja%^RESET%^g%^YELLOW%^g%^WHITE%^ed s%^RESET%^c%^BOLD%^r%^BLACK%^a%^WHITE%^p of m%^RESET%^e%^BOLD%^t%^RED%^a%^WHITE%^l%^RESET%^ 

The scrap is the key; the fragment is nothing, just junk. I would like the key to be randomly found on only one of the three mummies, if possible.

key, scrap : (item - long describe) 
%^RESET%^%^RED%^This long, %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^ja%^RESET%^g%^YELLOW%^g%^WHITE%^ed s%^RESET%^c%^BOLD%^r%^BLACK%^a%^WHITE%^p of m%^RESET%^e%^BOLD%^t%^RED%^a%^WHITE%^l%^ %^RESET%^%^RED%^has ridges and protrusions on one end. It could be some ruined piece of %^RESET%^jewelry%^RED%^, but its original shape appears as lost as the %^ORANGE%^corpse%^RED%^ from which it came. The scrap seems to faintly %^CYAN%^thr%^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^u%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^m%^RED%^ in your hands with some barely perceptible %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^energy%^RESET%^%^RED%^.%^RESET%^

bone fragment: ( item - short describe)
%^RESET%^a b%^BOLD%^one fragment%^RESET%^.

bone fragment : ( item - long describe)
 %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^This small, brittle fragment of ancient b%^RESET%^o%^BOLD%^ne is covered with dust.%^RESET%^


alcoves, alcove : 
%^RESET%^%^RED%^Three deep alcoves are built into the walls this dark %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^g%^RESET%^ra%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ni%^RESET%^te%^RED%^ corridor, each containing a strangely contorted %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^mummy%^RESET%^%^RED%^ as some sort of %^MAGENTA%^macabre%^RED%^ decoration.%^RESET%^

candles, flames, eye-sockets : 
%^RESET%^%^RED%^Small %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^black candles%^RESET%^%^RED%^ endlessly %^ORANGE%^burn%^RED%^ in the hollow eye-sockets of the %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^mummies%^RESET%^%^RED%^, the %^BOLD%^fl%^YELLOW%^a%^RED%^mes%^RESET%^%^RED%^ illuminating their shriveled, %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^menacing%^RESET%^%^RED%^ faces and providing the only %^YELLOW%^lig%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^h%^BOLD%^t%^RESET%^%^RED%^ in this dark corridor.%^RESET%^

walls : 
%^RESET%^%^RED%^The solid walls made of %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^bl%^RESET%^ac%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^k g%^RESET%^ra%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ni%^RESET%^te%^RED%^ seem to have been constructed in such a way to %^CYAN%^dampen%^RED%^ the sound around you.%^RESET%^

floor, tiles :
%^RESET%^%^RED%^The thick, %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^va%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^r%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^iega%^RESET%^t%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ed t%^RESET%^i%^MAGENTA%^l%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^es%^RESET%^%^RED%^ have been lain very evenly here, carefully placed so that the seams between them are barely visible, unlike the %^YELLOW%^j%^WHITE%^a%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^g%^RESET%^ge%^BOLD%^%^RED%^d%^RESET%^%^RED%^ tiles found elsewhere in the temple. The heavy ceramic tiles have been hardened by %^ORANGE%^fi%^RED%^r%^ORANGE%^e%^RED%^ and then individually gla%^MAGENTA%^z%^RED%^ed with %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^bla%^RESET%^c%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^k%^RESET%^%^RED%^ and %^MAGENTA%^p%^BOLD%^u%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^rple h%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^u%^MAGENTA%^e%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^s%^RED%^, leaving each tile completely unique. Somehow these durable tiles seem to %^CYAN%^dampen%^RED%^ the very sound of your own footsteps.%^RESET%^

Ceiling :
 %^RESET%^%^RED%^The ceiling is also made of solid %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^bl%^RESET%^ac%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^k g%^RESET%^ra%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ni%^RESET%^te%^RED%^, hanging oppressively low and giving it a tunnel-like feel.%^RESET%^


 (eastern door opens with touching of symbols -  Alzars mage room/lab. Sort of like the fence/gate over on Seneca or Lothwaite barrows. There are several symbols, only one combination will open the door. (One True Way))

eastern door, granite door  :
%^RESET%^%^RED%^A thick slab of %^YELLOW%^j%^RESET%^a%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^g%^RESET%^ge%^RED%^%^BOLD%^d %^BLACK%^bl%^RESET%^ac%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^k g%^RESET%^ra%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ni%^RESET%^te%^RED%^ serves as the entrance to a room on the easterly side of the corridor. The heavy door is smooth, with strange %^MAGENTA%^s%^BOLD%^y%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^mb%^BOLD%^o%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^ls%^RED%^ carved deeply into the metal surface. There is no handle anywhere on the door, but there some %^CYAN%^writing%^RED%^ carved into the door.%^RESET%^



symbols :
%^RESET%^%^RED%^These strange %^MAGENTA%^s%^BOLD%^y%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^mb%^BOLD%^o%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^ls%^RED%^ have been carved deeply into the %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^g%^RESET%^ra%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ni%^RESET%^te %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^door%^RESET%^%^RED%^ below some %^CYAN%^writing%^RED%^.

%^BOLD%^WHITE%^As you touch the %^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^s%^BOLD%^y%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^mb%^BOLD%^o%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^l%^WHITE%^%^BOLD%^, it briefly %^YELLOW%^cr%^BLACK%^a%^YELLOW%^ckles%^WHITE%^ with %^BLACK%^unh%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^o%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ly energy%^WHITE%^ before dimming again.%^RESET%^ 

[If you touch: power, death, false, prophet, supreme, fear] it gives you this message ?

(This door opens up to the torture chamber. I would prefer if the person attempting to open it does have the key in addition to finding the catch)

marble door, black marble door, southern door : 

%^RESET%^%^RED%^This massive %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^bla%^RESET%^%^BLUE%^c%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^k marble door%^RESET%^%^RED%^ serves as the southern terminus of the long, dark corridor. %^RESET%^Sh%^BOLD%^a%^RESET%^tter%^BOLD%^e%^RESET%^d %^BOLD%^bone%^RESET%^%^RED%^ fragments have been carefully arranged into a sunburst-pattern around a single jawless %^RESET%^sku%^BOLD%^l%^RESET%^l%^RED%^, all impressed into the %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^stone%^RESET%^%^RED%^ itself, likely by magical means. The absence of any observable handle on this extremely heavy door makes you wonder how it might be opened.%^RESET%^

      
skull, sunburst, bones :

%^RESET%^%^RED%^Actual human %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^bones%^RESET%^%^RED%^ have been pressed deeply into the %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^bla%^RESET%^%^BLUE%^c%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^k marble%^RESET%^%^RED%^ itself, likely by some magical means.
