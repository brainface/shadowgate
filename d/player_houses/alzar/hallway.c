***long describe***

%^RESET%^%^RED%^The stairwell leads to this long hallway, which has been constructed from the finest wood and stone. The temple's %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^bl%^RESET%^ac%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^k g%^RESET%^ra%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ni%^RESET%^te%^RED%^ serves as the walls' foundation, paneled midway with raw %^MAGENTA%^pur%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^p%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^l%^MAGENTA%^e hear%^ORANGE%^t%^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^w%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^ood%^RED%^, which give this section of the temple a slightly more sophisticated atmosphere. Located on the western side of the hallway is a %^MAGENTA%^wo%^ORANGE%^o%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^d%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^en door%^RED%^, nearly blending into the panels if not for its decorative %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^pyrograph%^RESET%^%^RED%^ burned into its surface. %^RED%^Tarnished %^RESET%^si%^BOLD%^lv%^RESET%^er%^RED%^ sconces shed light into deep recesses carved into the stone, illuminating various %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^stat%^WHITE%^u%^BLACK%^es%^RESET%^%^RED%^ engaged in graphic acts of violence set therein. A rich, once plush %^MAGENTA%^carpet%^RED%^ covers the floor's %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Va%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^r%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^iega%^RESET%^t%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ed t%^RESET%^i%^MAGENTA%^l%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^es%^RESET%^%^RED%^ and leads to a set of opulent %^ORANGE%^do%^BOLD%^u%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^ble do%^BOLD%^o%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^rs%^RED%^ at the very end of the hallway.%^RESET%^


***Listen***

%^RESET%^%^GREEN%^Only intermittent murmurs breaks the all encompassing silence. %^RESET%^


***Smell***
%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^The faint scent of decay barely reaches this well-tended hallway.%^RESET%^



stairs :
 %^RESET%^%^RED%^A twin pair of uneven %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^gr%^WHITE%^ani%^BLACK%^te%^RESET%^%^RED%^ stairs spiral upwards from opposite sides of the room, meeting twice upon their ascent until they are lost to sight,leading into an unseen chamber above. A tarnished railing that may once have been plated in %^RESET%^sh%^BOLD%^i%^RESET%^n%^BOLD%^i%^RESET%^ng sil%^BOLD%^v%^RESET%^er%^RED%^ forms a barrier around their outer edge.

walls :
 %^RESET%^%^RED%^The solid walls made of %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^bl%^RESET%^ac%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^k g%^RESET%^ra%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ni%^RESET%^te%^RED%^ rise up to meet the ceiling. Unlike the rest of the temple, the stone here has been paneled with a rich, knotty %^MAGENTA%^wo%^ORANGE%^o%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^d%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^en door%^RED%^ that start at the floor and end mid-way up the walls.%^RESET%^

panels :
 %^RESET%^%^RED%^Knotty %^MAGENTA%^pur%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^p%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^l%^MAGENTA%^e hear%^ORANGE%^t%^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^w%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^ood%^RED%^ panels adorn the %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^bl%^RESET%^ac%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^k g%^RESET%^ra%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ni%^RESET%^te%^RED%^ walls, giving the hallway a more sophisticated look. The panels start at the floor and end mid-way up the walls. Although the knots seem quite %^ORANGE%^natural%^RED%^ to the wood's unique %^MAGENTA%^gr%^ORANGE%^a%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^i%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^n%^RED%^, many of them look %^CYAN%^eer%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^i%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^ly%^RED%^ like faces with hollowed eyes and wide, gaping maws.

double oak doors, doors, double doors, oak doors : %^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^Luxurious oak double doors stand at the end of this long hallway. The doors were constructed out of the highest quality oak and treated with some unknown %^MAGENTA%^substance%^ORANGE%^ to strengthen them and add a high-gloss %^BOLD%^%^YELLOW%^shine%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^.  Each door has a detailed image of %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^undead creatures%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^ in %^BOLD%^%^RED%^gruesome scenes%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^ of %^RED%^carnage%^ORANGE%^ engraved upon their surface. The door handles are a black opal shaped into the form of a %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^nightmare%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^

wooden door, western door, door :
%^RESET%^%^RED%^The wooden door set in the western part of the hallway is composed of the same %^MAGENTA%^pur%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^p%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^l%^MAGENTA%^e hear%^ORANGE%^t%^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^w%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^ood%^RED%^ as the walls' panels. Knots and grain are clearly visible in the wood, but are dwarfed by a large %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^pyrograph%^RESET%^%^RED%^ of a dark sun e%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^t%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^c%^RED%^hed and bu%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^r%^RED%^n%^RESET%^%^RED%^ed into the surface. A simple %^RESET%^si%^BOLD%^lv%^RESET%^er%^RED%^ door knob allows access to the room beyond.%^RESET%^

pyrograph :
 %^RESET%^%^RED%^A simple yet powerful image of a %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^dark sun%^RESET%^%^RED%^ has been bu%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^r%^RED%^n%^RESET%^%^RED%^ed deeply into the surface of the door with some %^BOLD%^searing%^RESET%^%^RED%^ instrument, leaving a deep, %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^char%^RED%^r%^BLACK%^ed%^RESET%^%^RED%^ outline against the %^MAGENTA%^pur%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^p%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^l%^MAGENTA%^e-gr%^ORANGE%^a%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^i%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^ned wood%^RESET%^%^%^RED%^. The sun's dark %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^tendrils%^RESET%^%^RED%^ reach out from the center of the image, %^CYAN%^wh%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^o%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^rling%^RED%^ erratically across the door's surface.

floor, carpet :
%^RESET%^%^RED%^A rich, once plush%^MAGENTA%^ carpet%^RED%^ which appears to have once been quite luxurious covers most of the %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^t%^RESET%^i%^MAGENTA%^l%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ed%^RESET%^%^RED%^ floor here, leading towards the %^ORANGE%^do%^BOLD%^u%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^ble do%^BOLD%^o%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^rs%^RED%^ at the end of the hallway. The carpet's edges have become ragged and there are a few spots which suspiciously look like dried blo%^BOLD%^o%^RESET%^%^RED%^d.%^RESET%^

tiles :
 %^RESET%^%^RED%^The thick, %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Va%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^r%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^iega%^RESET%^t%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ed t%^RESET%^i%^MAGENTA%^l%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^es%^RESET%^%^RED%^ are visible in only a few places around the hallway's perimeter, where the %^MAGENTA%^carpet%^RED%^ does not cover.%^RESET%^ 

statues, recesses :
 %^RESET%^%^RED%^Cut deep into the %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^bl%^RESET%^ac%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^k g%^RESET%^ra%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ni%^RESET%^te%^RED%^ walls are several recesses, clearly designed for decorative purposes. Light from the sconces illuminates the %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^stat%^WHITE%^u%^BLACK%^es%^RESET%^%^RED%^ resting in the recesses. The %^GREEN%^masterfully%^RED%^ crafted art appears rather realistic in their depiction of various acts of %^MAGENTA%^grap%^RED%^h%^MAGENTA%^ic vio%^RED%^l%^MAGENTA%^ence%^RED%^. You may be able to take a closer look at the statues.%^RESET%^

statue 1 :
 %^RESET%^%^RED%^Carved from a %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^bla%^RESET%^%^BLUE%^c%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^k marble%^RESET%^%^RED%^ veined with glittering %^RESET%^si%^BOLD%^lv%^RESET%^er%^RED%^, this statue of a male human garbed in studded leathers st%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^r%^RESET%^%^RED%^angles another with a garr%^BOLD%^o%^RESET%^%^RED%^te, his eyes %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^wi%^YELLOW%^l%^BLACK%^d%^RESET%^%^RED%^ and full of %^MAGENTA%^ma%^BLUE%^l%^MAGENTA%^ice%^RED%^. The victim grabs at his throat with his hands, %^CYAN%^gasp%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^i%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^ng%^RED%^ for air.%^RESET%^

statue 2 :
 %%^RESET%^%^RED%^Intricately detailed from smooth %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^bla%^RESET%^%^BLUE%^c%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^k marble%^RESET%^%^RED%^ veined with glittering %^RESET%^si%^BOLD%^lv%^RESET%^er%^RED%^, this statue depicts a buxom woman cringing away from a shrouded figure brandishing a knife towards her. The artist seems to have captured the look of %^MAGENTA%^terr%^BLUE%^o%^MAGENTA%^r%^RED%^ on the woman's face with startling detail.%^RESET%^

statue 3 : 
%^RESET%^%^RED%^This statue crafted from an eye-catching %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^bla%^RESET%^%^BLUE%^c%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^k marble%^RESET%^%^RED%^ veined with glittering %^RESET%^si%^BOLD%^lv%^RESET%^er%^RED%^ shows an imposing male figure hoisting a se%^BOLD%^v%^RESET%^%^RED%^ered head up in the air. A %^ORANGE%^he%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^a%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^dl%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^e%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^ss%^RED%^ corpse lays twis%^CYAN%^t%^RED%^ed and cr%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^u%^RESET%^%^RED%^mpled at his feet, which forms the base of the statue.%^RESET%^

sconces : 
%^RESET%^%^RED%^Tarnished %^RESET%^si%^BOLD%^lv%^RESET%^er%^RED%^ sconces shed light into the hallway and illuminating the %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^stat%^WHITE%^u%^BLACK%^es%^RESET%^%^RED%^ in the dark recesses.%^RESET%^

ceiling : %^RESET%^%^RED%^The ceiling is also made of solid %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^bl%^RESET%^ac%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^k g%^RESET%^ra%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ni%^RESET%^te%^RED%^, which hands oppressively low and gives the hallway a tunnel-like feel.%^RESET%^
