***Long describe***


%^RESET%^%^RED%^This spacious room seems to function as a conference area where temple leaders convene. The walls are composed of the same %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^bl%^RESET%^ac%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^k g%^RESET%^ra%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ni%^RESET%^te%^RED%^ as the rest of the temple, reaching up to a dark, uneven ceiling. Most of the %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^t%^RESET%^i%^MAGENTA%^l%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ed%^RESET%^%^RED%^ floor is covered with a %^MAGENTA%^fra%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^y%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^ed carpet%^RED%^, clearly once quite luxurious. An irregularly shaped %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ebony table%^RESET%^%^RED%^ occupies most of this room's space, surrounded by several %^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^uph%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^o%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^lstered %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^chairs%^RESET%^%^RED%^, each uniquely carved into different erratic styles. An unusual %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^cha%^RESET%^n%^BOLD%^de%^BLACK%^l%^WHITE%^ier%^RESET%^%^RED%^ hangs over the table, constructed from a myriad of shattered pieces of %^WHITE%^gl%^BOLD%^a%^WHITE%^ss%^RESET%^%^RED%^, which distort whatever images reach the jagged, %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^re%^WHITE%^f%^CYAN%^lec%^WHITE%^t%^CYAN%^ive%^RESET%^%^RED%^ slivers.%^RESET%^

***Listen***
%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^The muted din of the %^WHITE%^gl%^BOLD%^a%^WHITE%^ss%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^ shards chimes disharmoniously.%^RESET%^

***Smell***
%^RESET%^%^GREEN%^A strange musty scent fills the air.%^RESET%^


Exits : east (wooden door, to hallway)
 
walls :
%^RESET%^%^RED%^Thick %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^bl%^RESET%^ac%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^k g%^RESET%^ra%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ni%^RESET%^te%^RED%^ forms the oppressively stark walls of this room, rising up above you towards the ceiling.%^RESET%^

 
floor, carpet : 
%^RESET%^%^RED%^A %^MAGENTA%^fra%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^y%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^ed carpet%^RED%^ which appears to have once been quite luxurious covers most of the %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^t%^RESET%^i%^MAGENTA%^l%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ed%^RESET%^%^RED%^ floor here. Its edges have become ragged and there are a few spots which suspiciously look like dried blo%^BOLD%^o%^RESET%^%^RED%^d. One particular section of the carpet is nearly %^CYAN%^threadbare%^RED%^, as if someone paces in the same spot quite often.%^RESET%^

chandelier :
%^RESET%^%^RED%^This unusual %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^cha%^RESET%^n%^BOLD%^de%^BLACK%^l%^WHITE%^ier%^RESET%^%^RED%^ is constructed from numerous shards of shattered %^WHITE%^gl%^BOLD%^a%^WHITE%^ss%^RESET%^%^RED%^ and held together with crude %^RESET%^si%^BOLD%^lv%^RESET%^er wire%^RED%^ around a ring of %^MAGENTA%^vi%^BOLD%^o%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^let candles%^RED%^ in the center. The glass is coated with %^RESET%^si%^BOLD%^lv%^RESET%^er%^RED%^, making each dangling sliver act like a broken %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^mi%^RESET%^r%^BOLD%^r%^BLACK%^o%^WHITE%^red%^RESET%^%^RED%^ shard that reflects and distorts %^CYAN%^images%^RED%^ as it refracts the dim light.%^RESET%^

 
table :
 %^RESET%^%^RED%^The large irregularly shaped table takes up most of the room and can accommodate plenty of people. The top of the table is a smooth, hard %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ebony wood%^RESET%^%^RED%^, painstakingly carved by some skilled artisan's hand. The table's perimeter is no real recognizable shape, almost haphazardly comprised of sharp curves, %^YELLOW%^j%^WHITE%^a%^BLACK%^g%^WHITE%^ge%^RED%^d%^RESET%^%^RED%^ edges and random cut-ins. Despite its unusual shape, this table is quite %^ORANGE%^magn%^BOLD%^i%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^ficent%^RED%^ to behold.%^RESET%^

 
chairs :
 %^RESET%^%^RED%^Several handcrafted %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ebony chairs%^RESET%^%^RED%^ sit around the irregularly shaped table. Each chair is unique from all the rest, carved into various eccentric styles, different than the one next to it. The %^MAGENTA%^vio%^BOLD%^l%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^et cr%^BOLD%^u%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^shed-velvet%^RED%^ upholstery on each chair unifies them as a set. Only one chair stands out amongst the others, being larger and more elaborate. Carved with the letter %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^'A'%^RESET%^%^RED%^, this particular chair seems reserved for someone of importance.%^RESET%^


door, wooden door :
%^RESET%^%^RED%^The wooden door leading out of this conference room is made of %^MAGENTA%^pur%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^p%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^l%^MAGENTA%^e hear%^ORANGE%^t%^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^w%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^ood%^RED%^. Knots and grain are clearly visible in the wood, but are dwarfed by a large %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^pyrograph%^RESET%^%^RED%^ of a dark sun e%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^t%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^c%^RED%^hed and bu%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^r%^RED%^n%^RESET%^%^RED%^ed into the surface. A simple %^RESET%^si%^BOLD%^lv%^RESET%^er%^RED%^ door knob allows access to the hallway beyond.%^RESET%^


pyrograph :
%^RESET%^%^RED%^A simple yet powerful image of a %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^dark sun%^RESET%^%^RED%^ has been bu%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^r%^RED%^n%^RESET%^%^RED%^ed deeply into the surface of the door with some %^BOLD%^searing%^RESET%^%^RED%^ instrument, leaving a deep, %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^char%^RED%^r%^BLACK%^ed%^RESET%^%^RED%^ outline against the %^MAGENTA%^pur%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^p%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^l%^MAGENTA%^e-gr%^ORANGE%^a%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^i%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^ned wood%^RESET%^%^%^RED%^. The sun's dark %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^tendrils%^RESET%^%^RED%^ reach out from the center of the image, %^CYAN%^wh%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^o%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^rling%^RED%^ erratically across the door's surface.
