%^RESET%^%^RED%^Torture Chamber%^RESET%^

***long describe***
%^RESET%^%^RED%^This large, dark chamber is enclosed by oppressive walls of %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^bl%^RESET%^ac%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^k g%^RESET%^ra%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ni%^RESET%^te%^RED%^. The vaulted ceiling slopes above the chamber in a smooth arcing dome, riddled at its apex with %^RESET%^holes%^RED%^ through which some strange t%^BOLD%^u%^RESET%^%^RED%^bes run. Several %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^metal cages%^RESET%^%^RED%^ dangle ominously above the chamber, secured by heavy chains to the ceiling, where a %^ORANGE%^pully system%^RED%^ is also present. A %^ORANGE%^wo%^BOLD%^o%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^den plat%^BOLD%^f%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^orm%^RED%^ allows passage around the room, situated a few feet above a sunken in %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^t%^RESET%^il%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ed flo%^RESET%^o%^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^r%^RESET%^%^RED%^ at the room's center. A few %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^steps%^RESET%^%^RED%^ lead down to the sunken area where the most gruesome practices seem to occur. %^RED%^A long, blo%^BOLD%^o%^RESET%^%^RED%^d-spat%^BOLD%^t%^RESET%^%^RED%^ered %^ORANGE%^table%^RED%^ stands conspicuously in the center, surrounded by racks of assorted %^MAGENTA%^h%^BLUE%^o%^MAGENTA%^rrif%^BLUE%^y%^MAGENTA%^ing %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^devices%^RESET%^%^RED%^ and discarded me%^MAGENTA%^a%^RED%^ty scr%^MAGENTA%^a%^RED%^ps. Three large %^WHITE%^%^BOLD%^vats%^RESET%^%^RED%^ are situated near the base of the table, each filled with %^GREEN%^grotes%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^q%^RESET%^%^GREEN%^ue%^RED%^ contents. Around the perimeter lie several %^ORANGE%^shelves%^RED%^ on which a multitude of items have been stored. Wrought-iron %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^braz%^WHITE%^i%^BLACK%^ers%^RESET%^%^RED%^ smolder and burn at each corner of the platform, shedding faint, %^MAGENTA%^bale%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^f%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^ul %^WHITE%^%^BOLD%^l%^YELLOW%^i%^WHITE%^ght%^RESET%^%^RED%^ across the grim chamber and barely illuminating the wretched %^MAGENTA%^victims%^RED%^ trapped within.%^RESET%^

***Listen***
%^MAGENTA%^The loud cries of the %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^tormented%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^ are projected throughout the chamber.%^RESET%^


***Smell***
%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^The sickeningly sweet smell of %^RED%^blood%^ORANGE%^ mingled with %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^acr%^RESET%^%^GREEN%^i%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^d sm%^WHITE%^o%^BLACK%^ke%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^ assaults your nose.%^RESET%^

Exits: (north  to corridor ) (trap door, or d  to recycling room)


***Items to look at and what have you***

victims :
%^RESET%^%^RED%^Several live, terrified %^MAGENTA%^victims%^RED%^ barely cling to life, weeping and shuddering inside the %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^metal cages%^RESET%^%^RED%^, grimly waiting either for death or their turn on the torturing table. A few dusty %^RESET%^bones%^RED%^ wrapped in %^CYAN%^aged%^RED%^ and %^ORANGE%^tattered clothing%^RED%^ remain in the old cages, evidence of past victims%^RESET%^


cages,  chains :
 %^RESET%^%^RED%^Several %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^metal cages%^RESET%^%^RED%^ dangle %^BLUE%^om%^MAGENTA%^i%^BLUE%^nou%^MAGENTA%^s%^BLUE%^ly%^RED%^ above the chamber, secured by heavy %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^chains%^RESET%^%^RED%^ to the ceiling. Several live %^MAGENTA%^victims%^RED%^ pitifully cling to life, while a few dusty %^RESET%^bones%^RED%^ wrapped in %^CYAN%^aged%^RED%^ and %^ORANGE%^tattered clothing%^RED%^ are all that remains of past victims.%^RESET%^

ceiling :
 %^RESET%^%^RED%^The high ceiling made of %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^bl%^RESET%^ac%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^k g%^RESET%^ra%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ni%^RESET%^te%^RED%^ seem to have been constructed in such a way that they project the %^MAGENTA%^shrieks%^RED%^ and %^CYAN%^cries%^RED%^ of the %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^tormented%^RESET%^%^RED%^ without ever allowing the sounds to outside. Hanging from the ceiling are some heavy %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^metal cages%^RESET%^%^RED%^ as well as a %^ORANGE%^block and tackle%^RED%^ system, clearly all instruments for this chamber's nefarious purpose.%^RESET%^



walls :
 %^RESET%^%^RED%^The thick walls made of %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^bl%^RESET%^ac%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^k g%^RESET%^ra%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ni%^RESET%^te%^RED%^ seem to have been constructed in such a way that they project the %^MAGENTA%^shrieks%^RED%^ and %^CYAN%^cries%^RED%^ of the %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^tormented%^RESET%^%^RED%^ without ever allowing the sounds to outside.%^RESET%^

perimeter, platform :
 %^RESET%^%^RED%^The raised platform is comprised of heavy %^ORANGE%^wooden planking%^RESET%^%^RED%^ that serves as a walkway around the room's perimeter. It is raised several feet above the sunken %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^t%^RESET%^il%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ed floor%^RESET%^%^RED%^ section so one may traverse the chamber without going through its %^RED%^g%^BOLD%^o%^RESET%^%^RED%^ry center. Although the platform looks sturdy, a few of the %^ORANGE%^planks%^RED%^ seem uneven.%^RESET%^

planks :
 %^RESET%^%^RED%^Several of the heavy %%^ORANGE%^wooden planks%^RED%^ are uneven in one spot, almost as if they are %^RESET%^loose%^RED%^.%^RESET%^

(Searching will allow the player to find the trap door to the recycling facility, down)

[search planks ? %^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^Upon closer inspection, you find (name finds) that the %^RESET%^loose planks%^ORANGE%^ are actually a trap door!%^RESET%^

trap door :
 %^RESET%^%^RED%^The trap door is carefully blended in to the rest of the %^ORANGE%^wooden planks%^RED%^ of the platform. It does look like it can be opened to reveal whatever lies beneath this horrific chamber.%^RESET%^ (can open trap door)

tubes, holes :
%^RESET%^%^RED%^Strange tubes run from the %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^drain%^RESET%^%^RED%^ below upward through the holes, filtering out the fetid %^GREEN%^flu%^BOLD%^i%^RESET%^%^GREEN%^ds%^RED%^ and carrying fresh %^BOLD%^blood%^RESET%^%^RED%^ to some unknown place.%^RESET%^




floor, tiles :
%^RESET%^%^RED%^The center of this room is a sunken-in, moisture-resistant %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^t%^RESET%^il%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ed floor%^RESET%^%^RED%^, grotesquely littered with %^ORANGE%^fleshy bits%^RED%^ and smeared with %^BOLD%^gore%^RESET%^%^RED%^. Fresh %^BOLD%^blood%^RESET%^%^RED%^ pools around a large %^RESET%^drain%^RED%^, which allows for easier disposal of %^GREEN%^f%^ORANGE%^l%^GREEN%^ui%^ORANGE%^d%^GREEN%^s%^RED%^. A few discarded %^WHITE%^teeth%^RED%^ and pryed out %^ORANGE%^fingernails%^RED%^ sit in the messy pool.%^RESET%^

scraps, gore :
%^RESET%^%^RED%^Shredded %^BOLD%^viscera%^RESET%^%^RED%^, ripped out %^MAGENTA%^entra%^RED%^i%^MAGENTA%^ls%^RED%^ and strips of %^ORANGE%^fla%^WHITE%^y%^ORANGE%^ed skin%^RED%^ are strewn about the g%^BOLD%^o%^RESET%^%^RED%^ry floor in a haphazard manner. Many %^BOLD%^meaty scraps%^RESET%^%^RED%^ seem to have been %^MAGENTA%^crudely t%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^o%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^rn%^RED%^ off their previous owners, rendering them unidentifiable, while others have been removed with %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^ch%^CYAN%^i%^WHITE%^ll%^CYAN%^i%^WHITE%^ng%^RESET%^%^RED%^ skill and accuracy.%^RESET%^  



devices, racks, tools :
%^RESET%^%^RED%^A myriad of devices and tools are ready for use on the %^ORANGE%^racks%^RED%^ within reach of the large table. One exclusively contains what looks like %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^surgical%^RESET%^%^RED%^ instruments - razor sharp %^RESET%^scalpels%^RED%^ of various sizes, %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^needles%^RESET%^%^RED%^ and heavy %^BLUE%^thread%^RED%^. Nearby, two additional racks hold the heavier devices - %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^saws%^RESET%^%^RED%^ that can hack through bones, %^CYAN%^pliers%^RED%^ to yank out teeth and nails, as well as sets of heavy %^RESET%^she%^BOLD%^e%^RESET%^rs%^RED%^ that appear able to sever flesh with a single snip. The largest rack holds an adjustable %^CYAN%^head crusher%^RED%^, a %^ORANGE%^leather scourge%^RED%^, several %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^branding irons%^RESET%^%^RED%^, a few %^CYAN%^hammers%^RED%^, and the dreaded %^MAGENTA%^pear of anguish%^RED%^.%^RESET%^


table, manacles :
%^RESET%^%^RED%^The long, %^ORANGE%^wooden table%^RESET%^%^RED%^ standing in the middle of the chamber's sunken section is large enough to accommodate several %^MAGENTA%^victims%^RED%^. Bolted deeply onto the table are multiple sets of %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^manacles%^RESET%^%^RED%^, made from the sturdiest of metals. The table is spattered with b%^BOLD%^l%^RESET%^%^RED%^o%^BOLD%^o%^RESET%^%^RED%^d and looks as if it has seen a lot of use. Near the table are three %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^ceramic vats%^RESET%^%^RED%^ as well as a %^ORANGE%^racks%^RED%^ of various %^RESET%^instruments%^RED%^ of torture.%^RESET%^

shelves, items :
 %^RESET%^%^RED%^The shelves lined up against the wall at the perimeter contain the rest of the torture instruments, many of which are ... %^MAGENTA%^alive%^RED%^! Flea-ridden, %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^rats%^RESET%^%^RED%^ are kept in boxes, the bottoms of which can be removed and placed on a victim's abdomen, through which the %^BLUE%^terrified%^RED%^ animals will burrow to escape. Colonies of %^ORANGE%^fire ants%^RED%^ live in jars, boxes of venomous %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^spiders%^RESET%^%^RED%^, %^GREEN%^snakes%^RED%^ and %^MAGENTA%^scorpions%^RED%^ are all stashed away on these shelves, amongst various %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^vials%^RESET%^%^RED%^ labeled: %^YELLOW%^honey%^RESET%^%^RED%^, %^GREEN%^acid%^RED%^, %^RESET%^salt%^RED%^, and %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^poison%^RESET%^%^RED%^. A large spool of %^ORANGE%^rope%^RED%^ is also stored on the shelves.%^RESET%^

block, tackle, system :
 %^RESET%^%^RED%^Strong %^ORANGE%^ropes%^RED%^ and %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^pulleys%^RESET%^%^RED%^ make up this block and tackle system, clearly kept here to string %^MAGENTA%^victims%^RED%^ up off the ground by their wrists.%^RESET%^

Spool, rope :
 %^RESET%^%^RED%^A large spool of %^ORANGE%^hemp rope%^RED%^ is here, clearly kept in the chamber to bind up prisoners. It looks very sturdy. It looks like you can %^RESET%^take%^RED%^ some rope from the spool. %^RESET%^

(You can take/get rope to put some basic rope in your inventory!)


vats :
 %^RESET%^%^RED%^Three %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^ceramic vats%^RESET%^%^RED%^ are within reach of the %^ORANGE%^table%^RED%^ and the torture %^RESET%^devices%^RED%^. Each of the vats no doubt serves their own purpose in this chamber of %^MAGENTA%^ho%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^r%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^rors%^RED%^. Perhaps you can get a closer look at each of them.%^RESET%^

vat 1 : 
%^RESET%^%^RED%^Hacked-off %^ORANGE%^hands%^RED%^, severed %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^fingers%^RESET%^%^RED%^, discarded %^RESET%^ears%^RED%^ and other dismembered %^BOLD%^body parts%^RESET%^%^RED%^ are stacked to the brim of this large %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^ceramic vat%^RESET%^%^RED%^. The parts look %^CYAN%^fresh%^RED%^, as if they've been recently thrown inside the full %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^vat%^RESET%^%^RED%^, which suggests that it is likely cleaned out and %^YELLOW%^refilled%^RESET%^%^RED%^ often.%^RESET%^  


vat 2, corpse :  %^RESET%^%^RED%^A single %^GREEN%^bloa%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^t%^RESET%^%^GREEN%^ed %^ORANGE%^c%^GREEN%^o%^ORANGE%^rpse%^RED%^, swarming with %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^insects%^RESET%^%^RED%^ and a funnel crammed down its %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^st%^YELLOW%^i%^BLACK%^nk%^GREEN%^i%^BLACK%^ng %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^mouth%^RESET%^%^RED%^, sits in this large %^ORANGE%^ceramic vat%^RED%^. The vat is filled with rank-smelling thick %^ORANGE%^fl%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^u%^YELLOW%^i%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^ds%^RESET%^%^RED%^ that appear to be %^RESET%^spoiled milk%^RED%^, %^ORANGE%^honey%^RED%^ and %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^feces%^RESET%^%^RED%^. It appears that this unfortunate bastard died through the foul practice of %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^scaphism%^RESET%^%^RED%^, where the victim is force fed %^RESET%^milk%^RED%^ and covered with %^ORANGE%^honey%^RED%^, left to slowly %^MAGENTA%^die%^RED%^ and %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^rot%^RESET%^%^RED%^ in their own %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^waste%^RESET%^%^RED%^ as insects assault their exposed body.%^RESET%^


vat 3, acid  (after filled) %^RESET%^%^RED%^This round %^CYAN%^ceramic vat%^RED%^ filled with a pungent %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^ac%^WHITE%^i%^GREEN%^d%^RESET%^%^RED%^. The vat is not large enough to house a whole body, but deep and wide enough to accommodate half an average human's body. The liquid %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^steams%^RESET%^%^RED%^ and continuously %^GREEN%^b%^BOLD%^u%^WHITE%^b%^RESET%^b%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^l%^GREEN%^e%^RESET%^%^GREEN%^s%^RED%^ in the vat, almost as if it is in anticipation of its next %^MAGENTA%^victim%^RED%^.%^RESET%^


brazier, braziers : 
%^RESET%^%^RED%^Ornate wrought-iron %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^braz%^WHITE%^i%^BLACK%^ers%^RESET%^%^RED%^ sit in each corner of the platform. They continuously sm%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^o%^RESET%^%^RED%^lder and b%^ORANGE%^u%^RED%^rn, shedding faint, %^MAGENTA%^bale%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^f%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^ul %^WHITE%^%^BOLD%^l%^YELLOW%^i%^WHITE%^ght%^RESET%^%^RED%^ across the grim chamber.%^RESET%^

(This door opens up to the corridor. I would prefer if the person attempting to open it does have the key in addition to finding the catch)

marble door, black marble door : 

%^RESET%^%^RED%^This massive %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^bla%^RESET%^%^BLUE%^c%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^k marble door%^RESET%^%^RED%^ serves as the southern terminus of the long, dark corridor. %^RESET%^Sh%^BOLD%^a%^RESET%^tter%^BOLD%^e%^RESET%^d %^BOLD%^bone%^RESET%^%^RED%^ fragments have been carefully arranged into a sunburst-pattern around a single jawless %^RESET%^sku%^BOLD%^l%^RESET%^l%^RED%^, all impressed into the %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^stone%^RESET%^%^RED%^ itself, likely by magical means. The absence of any observable handle on this extremely heavy door makes you wonder how it might be opened.%^RESET%^

      
skull, sunburst, bones :

%^RESET%^%^RED%^Actual human %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^bones%^RESET%^%^RED%^ have been pressed deeply into the %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^bla%^RESET%^%^BLUE%^c%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^k marble%^RESET%^%^RED%^ itself, likely by some magical means. A fleshless, %^RESET%^bleached sku%^BOLD%^l%^RESET%^l%^RED%^ features prominently in the center of the door, its jaw missing. %^RESET%^Sh%^BOLD%^a%^RESET%^tter%^BOLD%^e%^RESET%^d %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^bone %^RESET%^%^RED%^fragments have been carefully arranged around the skull in a sunburst pattern, with %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^wh%^WHITE%^o%^BLACK%^rl%^WHITE%^i%^BLACK%^ng be%^WHITE%^a%^BLACK%^ms%^RESET%^%^RED%^ emanating from the central disk, narrowing as they get further from the center.%^RESET%^

%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^As you carefully search the %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^bla%^RESET%^%^BLUE%^c%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^k marble door%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^, you realize the only place you cannot see is inside the %^RESET%^s%^BOLD%^k%^RESET%^u%^BOLD%^l%^RESET%^l%^ORANGE%^ embedded in the heavy door.%^RESET%^

search skull :
%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^On closer inspection it appears that there is a small catch inside each of the %^BLACK%^%^BOLD%^eye-sockets%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^ of the %^RESET%^s%^BOLD%^k%^RESET%^u%^BOLD%^l%^RESET%^l%^ORANGE%^. Perhaps you can %^RESET%^insert%^ORANGE%^ your %^RESET%^fingers%^ORANGE%^ in there?%^RESET%^
