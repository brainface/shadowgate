%^RESET%^%^RED%^Recycling Facility%^RESET%^

***Long Describe***

%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^On first glance this deep pit appears to be little more than an underground mass grave where the temple discards the many %^RED%^ma%^WHITE%^n%^RED%^gled rema%^WHITE%^i%^RED%^ns%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^ of its torture victims. The heavy, %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^stone walls%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^ rise up to the ceiling overhead, set with a trap door, which appears to be the only way out of this rank, repulsive chamber. Oddly, a few sets of %^BOLD%^BLACK%^manacles%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^ are fastened to the wall nearest the trap door. %^WHITE%^Bones%^ORANGE%^ are scattered across the floor, which is made up of densely packed dirt. The floor is wet and muddy in some spots due to the putrefied %^GREEN%^flu%^BOLD%^i%^RESET%^%^GREEN%^ds%^ORANGE%^ oozing from the %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^insect-infested %^RESET%^%^RED%^corpses%^ORANGE%^ piled up and left in various stages of %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^dec%^GREEN%^o%^BLACK%^mp%^WHITE%^o%^BLACK%^st%^GREEN%^i%^BLACK%^on%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^. The faint light leaking through the boards of the overhead trap door does little to illuminate this dark hole. The furthest reaches of this pit are completely obscured by %^BLUE%^shadows%^ORANGE%^, which almost seem to shudder and tremble of their own volition.%^RESET%^ 

***Listen***

%^RESET%^%^GREEN%^Something rustles faintly within the %^BLUE%^shadows%^GREEN%^.%^RESET%^

***Smell***

%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^The overpowering smell of %^GREEN%^pu%^BOLD%^t%^RESET%^%^GREEN%^ri%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^f%^RESET%^%^GREEN%^icat%^BOLD%^i%^RESET%^%^GREEN%^on%^ORANGE%^ assaults your nose.%^RESET%^


Exits: (trap door or up, leads to torture chamber)

(okay  the following room effects are preferable, but if its more trouble than its worth, Octo, toss them out. I think it would add a lot to the room itself, though. I have colored and written two effects: a wisdom/will save (fear) and a con check/fortitude save (sheer ick). While there are no mobs/undead in here, there are echoes of them and I think these effects would aid in making this a truly putrid and horrifying place)

Wisdom check / will save message  ?
%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^A feeling of dread creeps into your mind you as something seems to reach out from the shadows.%^RESET%^

will save ?
 %^RESET%^%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^You shake off the feeling of dread and hold your ground.%^RESET%^ 
(other see: %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^NAME seems to shakes something off, remaining %^WHITE%^composed%^BLACK%^.%^RESET%^)

Will fail ? %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^You shudder and shake, frozen in %^RESET%^%^BLUE%^terror%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^!%^RESET%^ 
(others see: %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^NAME Shudders and shakes, overcome by %^RESET%^%^BLUE%^terror%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^!%^RESET%^

Con check / fortitude save ?
%^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^The room starts to spin as the suffocating stench starts to make you %^YELLOW%^d%^WHITE%^i%^YELLOW%^z%^WHITE%^z%^YELLOW%^y%^GREEN%^.%^RESET%^

con save ?
 %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^A wave of nausea washes over you, but you are able to keep your %^WHITE%^composure%^GREEN%^.%^RESET%^ 
(Others see: %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^NAME looks faint for a moment and seems to %^WHITE%^choke%^GREEN%^ something down.%^RESET%^)

Con fail ? %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^The horrid stink of the %^BLACK%^dec%^GREEN%^o%^BLACK%^mp%^WHITE%^o%^BLACK%^s%^GREEN%^i%^BLACK%^ng%^GREEN%^ remains forces you to be %^YELLOW%^sick%^GREEN%^ to your stomach.%^RESET%^ 

(others see: %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^NAME is overcome by the horrid stink and %^YELLOW%^vomits%^GREEN%^ in the dirt.%^RESET%^)

[here I have some searching  it doesnt turn up anything real, like real monsters, but it does create a neat feel for the room]

search shadows  ? room emote
 %^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^A few %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^undead%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^ are revealed hidden in the %^BLUE%^shadows%^ORANGE%^, but they are strangely chained to the walls!%^RESET%^

search shadows ? (for the second time) room emote 
 %^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^As (Name) you approach the %^BLUE%^shadows%^ORANGE%^, a %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^zombie%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^ lunges at you, almost ripping its own limb off as it tries to get to you!%^RESET%^ 

**items to look at **

shadows :
 %^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^The %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^shadows%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^ completely obscure the area furthest away from the scant %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^lig%^YELLOW%^h%^WHITE%^t%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^ filtered through the trap door. They %^BLUE%^tremble%^ORANGE%^ and %^MAGENTA%^shudder%^ORANGE%^ on their own, suggesting that something terrible is hidden within them.%^RESET%^

ceiling :
 %^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^The ceiling is little more than heavy wood planks, fastened together and secured by cross beams. It is too high from the dirty floor to reach by most without a ladder of some sort.%^RESET%^

walls : %^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^The high walls of this chamber are made of solid, rough-hewn %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^stone%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^. The walls closest to the trap door have several sets of %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^manacles%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^ fastened on them.%^RESET%^
 
trap door :
 %^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^The trap door is made of heavy wood fastened together that allows a few scant beams of %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^lig%^YELLOW%^h%^WHITE%^t%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^ to creep through where the planks meet. Its frame is secured into the ceiling, which appears to be underneath %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^platform%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^ of the torture chamber above. It seems to be the only exit out of here.%^RESET%^

manacles :
 %^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^These sturdy metal %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^manacles%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^ are firmly fixed on the walls closest to the trap door. The victim's %^RESET%^wrists%^ORANGE%^ can be locked into them, forcing those unfortunate souls to endure this %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^sic%^GREEN%^k%^BLACK%^eni%^RED%^n%^BLACK%^gly of%^RED%^f%^BLACK%^ens%^GREEN%^i%^BLACK%^ve%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^ scene.%^RESET%^

remains, corpses :
%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^An assortment of humanoid %^RED%^remains%^ORANGE%^ and dismembered %^RED%^body parts%^ORANGE%^ in various stages of %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^dec%^GREEN%^o%^BLACK%^mp%^WHITE%^o%^BLACK%^st%^GREEN%^i%^BLACK%^on%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^ are littered throughout this pit. Some appear %^BOLD%^%^RED%^fresh%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^, while others have decayed into an unidentifiable %^GREEN%^pu%^BOLD%^t%^RESET%^%^GREEN%^ri%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^f%^RESET%^%^GREEN%^i%^BOLD%^e%^RESET%^%^GREEN%^d mess%^ORANGE%^. A host of various scavenging %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^insects%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^ help break down the discolored, rotting %^RED%^c%^MAGENTA%^a%^RED%^rcas%^GREEN%^s%^RED%^es%^ORANGE%^ as they feast upon them. These fetid remains are the primary source of the %^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^foul stench%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^.%^RESET%^


insects :
 %^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^A host of %^WHITE%^maggots%^ORANGE%^, %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^flies%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^, and flesh-eating%^MAGENTA%^ beetles%^ORANGE%^ swarm the %^GREEN%^feste%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^r%^RESET%^%^GREEN%^ing%^ORANGE%^ flesh as they feast upon it.%^RESET%^

bones :
 %^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^The humanoid %^WHITE%^bones%^ORANGE%^ seem to have been completely picked clean of all their %^RED%^meat%^ORANGE%^ and cracked open, sucked dry of their %^MAGENTA%^marrow%^ORANGE%^. Perhaps the scavenging %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^insects%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^ consumed the soft tissues, but the deep %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^gouge marks%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^ present on these %^WHITE%^bones%^ORANGE%^ suggest that something gnawed on them.%^RESET%^

floor, dirt : 
%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^The dirt floor is hard packed, as if this pit was dug a long time ago and has seen quite a bit of use. A host of humanoid %^RED%^parts%^ORANGE%^ are strewn across the floor, from cleanly-picked %^WHITE%^bones%^ORANGE%^, to rotten %^GREEN%^flu%^BOLD%^i%^RESET%^%^GREEN%^d-oo%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^z%^RESET%^%^GREEN%^ing %^RED%^limbs%^ORANGE%^. You should be careful where you step.%^RESET%^



***ROOM ECHOES***
1) %^RESET%^%^GREEN%^A %^RED%^se%^BOLD%^v%^RESET%^%^RED%^e%^BOLD%^r%^RESET%^%^RED%^ed leg%^GREEN%^ is slowly dragged from a pile into the murky %^BLUE%^shadows%^GREEN%^, where it disappears completely.%^RESET%^ 

2) %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^The sounds of %^RESET%^%^GREEN%^gu%^RED%^t%^GREEN%^tu%^RED%^r%^GREEN%^al %^RED%^slu%^GREEN%^r%^RED%^ps%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ emerge from the depths of the %^RESET%^%^BLUE%^shadows%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^.%^RESET%^ 
 
3) %^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^A cleanly picked %^RESET%^bone%^ORANGE%^ is suddenly pitched out from the %^BLUE%^shadows%^ORANGE%^, landing by your feet!%^RESET%^
