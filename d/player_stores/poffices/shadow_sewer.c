/* Notes regarding problems encountered with the traps.... *mutter*
unlock lock on iron bound door with key
str is lock.
The guard catches you trying to get into the back room and attacks!
Shop guard positions himself to block the east exit
The glyph on the door suddenly glows brightly!
The air around you begins to shimmer.
Glyph takes in a deep breath and screams the words, 'HARRNES RUCKONUS!!!'
You reel backward, momentarily stunned by the power of Glyph's spell!

> > > > What traps are you attempting to remove
-------------------------
As you trace the runes around the glyph they glow, albeit briefly.
What traps are you attempting to remove
> > Is one of the toggle traps causing this?
--------------
// something is causing "unlock iron bound door with key" be ignored entirely
// required "unlock lock on iron bound door with key"
// pick lock on iron bound door was also ignored, but pick iron bound door said it was unlocked

need an error message for no tools on attempts to pick in the /std/Object code
with trap for pick set on iron bound door - no response to pick at all

test an elemental trying to open the door, etc.

I'm not positive the toggle traps is exactly right yet so don't use this as a fully tested and correct example.  However, I think it's close for trapping so many actions and lock as well as the door - *Styx*  4/6/03
