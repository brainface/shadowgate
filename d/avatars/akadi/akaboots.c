%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Oddly enough, these boots seemed to have transpired out of thin air and have been a mystery ever since. Many speculate that the Queen of the Air herself blessed the world with this unique gift although that has never been proven, and, although many Akadian priests have attempted to discover their origin, they eventually grew bored with the project and moved onto some new fascination, leaving the mystery unsolved.%^RESET%^
