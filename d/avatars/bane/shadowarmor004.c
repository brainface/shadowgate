The gloves forged of shadows. Worn only by agents of the Shadow Lord, slaves to his will, never to be free, but always willing. Made by the clergy of the Lord of Shadows for agents of their lord for multiple reasons. First is to keep them safe and protected by the Lord himself. Second is to conceal the wearer in an attempt to aid them in their mission. Third is so the clergy and their Lord can watch the agent and control it to whatever end.
