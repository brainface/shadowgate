%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^Made from a pale, earthy-brown leather, this hat is styled with a wide, flexible brim that provides protection for the face and sheds water off the collar instead of down one's back.  The cap is pinched to a %^RESET%^point %^ORANGE%^in the front, creating a pair of ridges that angle back around the top of the head.  A strip of %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^black silk %^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^ribbon is fitted around the inner edge of the brim, providing a little contrast as well as a place to secure a %^RESET%^feather %^ORANGE%^or other such %^MAGENTA%^token%^ORANGE%^.  The brim can be turned up or down in the front, providing a little %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^shade %^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^for the eyes, or creating a different style all together.%^RESET%^

Like the "wide brimmed gray", a wool hat of similar styling, that became so popular with the docks men and sailors in the mid-fifth century the leather fedora was favored by the city goers for many of the same reasons.  The wide brim could be turned up or down depending on the mood of the person.  Providing shade or a clear view, while shedding water and granting protection from the sun.  That the brim could also be shaped and set with a pin or other fixture added to the appear of the hat, which some even had enchanted so that their sense of style wasn't obscured by their need for protective ware.
