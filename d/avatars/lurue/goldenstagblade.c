%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^The hilt of this two handed sword is entwined in %^GREEN%^emerald wire %^ORANGE%^that appears to be molded after rose vines, complete with tiny %^MAGENTA%^amethyst %^ORANGE%^and %^WHITE%^pearl %^ORANGE%^roses that grow upon its length.  The vines extend up and around the antler shapped cross guard, curling back toward the hilt to add a basket of sorts that protects the wielder's hands.  The blade itself is a length of %^YELLOW%^golden metal %^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^that shimmers with a nearly divine light.  The full length is untouched by any form of etching or design work, which makes it almost more stunning then if it had been adorned fully.  Upon the pommel, a glittering %^RED%^ruby %^ORANGE%^has been set, and through it, you can see the %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^rampant stag %^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^insignia that seems to just go with this brilliant weapon.%^RESET%^

%^RED%^Remembered from an ancient journal:%^RESET%^  As the fog of morning burned away under the noon day sun, the countless hoards of the Dresttel were revealed.  Even with their General, Ta'marni the Golden Stag, the forces of Inomor felt their hearts stutter and fear clutch at their souls.  Thousands upon thousands spread out over the fertile valley, their orcish features horrific in the light of day.  And for a moment, the men and women of Inomor thought to run.  But Ta'marni lifted his great sword Akarel above his head and called out to the gods who, knowing of his right, sent the fire of righteousness down upon the lifted golden blade, which in turn cast the light over the Dresttel hoards.
