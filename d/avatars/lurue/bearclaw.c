%^RESET%^Made from sturdy, tanned leather and covered in %^ORANGE%^thick brown fur%^RESET%^, this hand covers look less like a glove and more like a bear's paw.  The fur is coarse and mottled with %^ORANGE%^brown%^RESET%^, %^YELLOW%^gold%^RESET%^, %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^black %^RESET%^and %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^gray %^RESET%^shades to it.  Extending from each finger are shards of %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^ivory%^RESET%^, darkened and made glossy so that they gleam a pale %^YELLOW%^y%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^e%^YELLOW%^l%^BLACK%^l%^RESET%^o%^YELLOW%^w-g%^RESET%^r%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^a%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^y%^RESET%^.  These have been filed to sharp, sturdy points, much the way one would expect bear claws to look in the wild.  Sewn into the glove, between the lairs of leather, are reinforcements of %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^bone %^RESET%^to provide strength and power to this curious weapon.%^RESET%^

The people of the Veymer tribe believe that each person is born with a guardian animal.  One which will grant them powers and insight into their true selves as they reach maturity.  When a Veymer child reaches his fifteenth year, he goes into the wilds and beseeches his animal to reveal itself to him.  When the animal appears, the young Veymer is granted insight into his future and what he will become.  Those who have bears appear become warriors of the tribe, exceptional combatants who specialize in close fighting, often called boxing.  Some, who feel exceptionally close to their guardian spirits will even make garments and weapons to resemble their guardian spirit's form.
