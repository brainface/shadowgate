%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^This pair of heavy leather boots is formed out of thick cowhide dyed a deep shade of %^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^russet brown%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^.  Over the top of this leather, squares of %^RESET%^metal %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^have been sewn, providing a bit of extra protection for the foot and ankle, though the addition makes them that much heavier then leather alone.  The thick soles are softened by a lining of soft %^RESET%^rabbit fur%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^, and supported by two strips of metal studded with small %^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^spikes %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^that allow them to get a firm, solid grip on the ground.  The combination of which would allow one to travel easily over difficult ground, without becoming as strained and tired.  Small decorations of %^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^braided fringe%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ and %^RESET%^b%^ORANGE%^e%^RED%^a%^RESET%^d%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^s add a little flare to these otherwise clunky boots.%^RESET%^

There are many tales about similar boots, born from the many copies that have been made over the years.  But most agree that the original set was crafted by a halfling named Tesolmela Halftop, who served Shandakul in her young life and Akadi later on.  Tesolmela was said to have spent her whole life caught up with the need to travel.  The need was almost curse like, it is said that she was compelled to view every sight to be found in the world and that she would not be permitted to stop until she had done so.  Because of this, Tesolmela created several items to aid in her journeys.  These boots gave her a more solid footing, as well as, aiding in her climbing over dangerous areas where a secure grip was required.
