%^RESET%^%^GREEN%^Clearly crafted by elven hand, this longsword is finely made and very ornate despite its simple form.  The blade itself is forged of the finest mithril and tinted so that it holds a greenish tint that grows darker the closer it gets to the central blood groove.  Further, dark green glyphs have been etched up and down the blade, covering the surface in their faintly glowing scrollwork.  The crosspiece is a simple beam of mithril shaped to look like a bow, complete with a band of sinew that stretches from either end to the ball shaped pommel.  A groove in the ball of the pommel keeps this string of sinew from slipping down onto the leather wrapped hilt of the blade.%^RESET%^

These swords are said to be fashioned by skilled elven magi who have learned to bind the art of smithing with the craft of magic.  Bound within the mithril is a spell of power, which those who have mastered the blade are capable of calling upon when engaging in specific movements.  Though rarely seen outside of an elf's grip, there are a select few that have been awarded over the years to members of other races as a reward for aid to the elven people.
