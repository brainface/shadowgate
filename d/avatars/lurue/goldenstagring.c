%^RED%^Remembered from an ancient journal:%^RESET%^  The light of the heavens snuffed out as the dark bolt struck the Golden Stag, General ta'marni.  Above the battle, the witch Drutok'tre laughed and ordered her forces forward, sending bands of darkness down to strengthen each in turn.  Though far fewer then began, the hoards of Dresttel surged with renewed vigor, but the anger and sorrow of the Inomor, seeing their great leader dead, filled the very land with sorrow.  Such sorrow that even the vegetation felt their pain and rose up, surrounding and trapping the Dresttel, dragging them down into the earth until nothing but the dark bands upon their hands remained to remind the Inomor warriors where their enemies had once stood.
