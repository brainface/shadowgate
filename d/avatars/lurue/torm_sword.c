%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^Intricate lines have been carved into the hilt of the sword, making it resemble a spiral of %^BOLD%^water %^RESET%^%^CYAN%^swirling upwards.

After the war between Tonovi and the surrounding lands, the City of Torm realized that their standing army was ill equipped to meet the challenges that continued to plague the regions.  Not only had General Telkaror betrayed the city and led the majority of the senior guards to their death in the drow war upon Daggerdale, but the attacks by pirates, bandits and other entities had taxed the regiments.  It became clear that not only were more guards needed, but suitable armor and weapons to protect them.  And so, in 685 SG the Vizier commissioned Gigi's of Torm to design and manufacture the necessary items to provide additional protection to the troops.  Created by a renown master weaponsmith, this sword, along with other armaments, were presented to the city after several months of taxing work.
