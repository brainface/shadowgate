%^RESET%^Created from supple %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^gray leather%^RESET%^, this belt and pouch combo appear ordinary but for the intricate tool working on the leather.  The wide belt is edged with thick %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^black twine %^RESET%^that protects and strengthens its surface.  Evenly spaced between and about two inches apart from one another are %^MAGENTA%^amethyst %^RESET%^and %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^silver %^RESET%^studs.  Surrounding these can be seen a melody of looping swirls that might be indicative of %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^wind%^RESET%^, %^CYAN%^water %^RESET%^or %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^shadows%^RESET%^.  The buckle is likewise %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^silver %^RESET%^and is styled as two hands clasping, the fingernails highlighted in %^MAGENTA%^amethyst %^RESET%^half moons.  The pouch is rectangular in design and likewise decorated with the same swirls and ribbons as the belt.  A flap closes over the top and has a matching buckle to keep it closed.%^RESET%^

These pouches are highly sought after by those who need to travel light but are forced to travel in dangerous places.  Besides holding a few small personal items that the wearer might need, each pouch is enchanted to summon healing potions.  The wearer simply need to focus their mind on their desire and will the potions to the top.  The pouch will supply them with a small cluster of kits that should help in such a situation.  Of course, such magic is limited and once the power is used it may be a while before it can be used again.  Since the pouches must summon a kit from a local location, there is also no guarantee what strength the kits will be.
