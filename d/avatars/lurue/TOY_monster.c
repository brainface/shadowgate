%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^This little stuffed animal is humanoid in shape with two legs and two arms and a curly little tail.  All covered in a thick, rich pelt of soft curly sheep's wool.  Shiny %^GREEN%^green buttons %^BLACK%^have been used for eyes and somewhere in all that thick weave is a small %^MAGENTA%^pink nose %^BLACK%^button.  What makes this little creature so cute though are the tiny %^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^brown leather horns %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^and the oversized, floppy %^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^brown leather ears%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^. Though he's a monster, it's hard to be scared of him with such a dopey %^RED%^red yarn%^BLACK%^ grin.%^RESET%^
