%^BOLD%^Cafe of the Crown and Castle, Tabor%^RESET%^
%^CYAN%^This is the %^MAGENTA%^cafe %^CYAN%^of the inn, probably one of the finest places to eat in
all of Tabor outside of the %^YELLOW%^Great Hall %^RESET%^%^CYAN%^in %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Caer Tabor%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^.  However, Amergin
is frequently hired to cater the larger Royal feasts.  The chef of this
cafe is a %^BOLD%^Tsarvani %^RESET%^%^CYAN%^from Verhedin who is a master of that cuisine.  Some
of the %^BOLD%^Tsarvani cuisine %^RESET%^%^CYAN%^is a bit hard to take, so they also offer a few
standard %^MAGENTA%^luxury dishes %^CYAN%^as well.  Either way, this is the best food in
all of Tabor and perhaps anywhere north of Verhedin.

%^RESET%^There is a menu here you can read.

The hall of the inn is to the north.
