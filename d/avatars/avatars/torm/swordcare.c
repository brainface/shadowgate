This is a very fine example of a kit used by master swordsmiths and swordsmen to care for very important blades.  Traditionally these items are used for the proper care of exquisite katana.  It is a mark of one who is very well versed in the traditions of katana to own a kit such as this.  The uchiko powder is formed with great care from dried polishing liquid and stone that has been very finely ground.  The paper has been made from the inner bark of a mulberry tree.
