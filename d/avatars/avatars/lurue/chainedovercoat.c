%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^This tailored garment is formed out of black leather with a contrasting panel of %^RESET%^slate-gray %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^down the front.  The foot-wide, V-shaped panel fastens down the middle of the garment, extending from neck to waist and fastened with cleverly hidden hook-and-eye closure on either side.  Over the panel links of %^RESET%^tarnished silver chain %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^form accents extending in a zigzag along the panel's edge.  This chain motif can be found on the back as well, hanging in several cape-like, ever widening loops from the shoulders to the waist, with dangling trim on either side.  The overcoat has long sleeves that end at the wrists in wide cuffs where more of the %^RESET%^tarnished silver links %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^can be found pinning the upturned cuffs.  A stiff black leather collar peaks high along the neck, brushing the underside of the jaw and chin in the front and rising to nearly the top of the head in back.   The garment ends at just above the ankles, sweeping out in a wide swath of leather.%^RESET%^
