%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Looking closely at this circlet you realized that over two hundred tiny %^WHITE%^bones %^BLACK%^have been used to form this circlet. In amazing detail, each tiny bone is a perfect replica of the human skeletal system in tiny miniature.  Starting with the skull, which is placed directly over the brow and whose eyes hold a pair of %^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^amethyst orbs%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^, the circlet is fashioned using the curved rib bones to create the circular structure of the circlet.  These are joined together by the vertebrae to extend their curves and make the circlet somewhat adjustable.  While the pelvic bones provide a clasp in the back.  The small bones of the hands and feet, create a mosaic of curls and curves that surround the skull, the pattern %^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^unfathomable %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^and %^RESET%^forgotten %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^as soon as it is focused upon.  Strangely the arm and leg bones point inward, as though they are meant to be driven into the wearer's skull.%^RESET%^
