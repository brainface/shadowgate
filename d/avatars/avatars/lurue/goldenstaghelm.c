%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^This large full-faced helm is designed for protection, though its stylish design makes it a beautiful, artistic headpiece as well.

Crowning the helm is a set of %^YELLOW%^golden antlers%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^.  At least twenty points on either side, they are both massive and majestic.  Each tip is inset with shards of %^RED%^rubies%^ORANGE%^, giving them the illusion of having %^RED%^blood%^ORANGE%^ dripping down their lengths.  %^RESET%^

%^RED%^Remembered from an ancient journal:%^RESET%^ The Golden Stag, the General Ta'marni, surged through the tide of men, his aura of power a shield against even the bravest of warriors.  From dawn till dusk, he turned the tide with just his presence alone.  For in his wake, his warriors traveled, taking courage and strength from the prowess of their leader and his unstoppable desire to stop the Dresttel.  No matter where he stepped, all could see him, for the golden horns which rose upon the great helm that graced his head.  Catching the morning's light and glittering beckoningly to the forces of Inomor.
