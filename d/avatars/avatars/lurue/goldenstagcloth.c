%^RED%^Remembered from an ancient journal:%^RESET%^ Only one of the Dresttel escaped the earth's summoning.  The Seer Drutok'tre whose flight to escape the reaching vines cast her into the deep void from which she had summoned the Immare.  But the void could not contain the essence of life and rejected what remained of her as soon as she entered.  Casting out the fabric of essence, bound with the living darkness of the void.  The fabric drifted far from the sight of the battle, escaping the Inomor's uplifted weapons that stabbed and cut at the being made other.  And so Drutok'tre fled and continues to flee, the descendants of the Inomor still seeking to destroy the last of her essence.
