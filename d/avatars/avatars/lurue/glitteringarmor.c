%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^At first look, this sheet of ice appears to be a misshapen giant's bowl.  Small spikes, rimmed in frost, adorn one side, providing a means to keep the bowl upright, while the inside is smooth and polished to a %^WHITE%^g%^CYAN%^l%^BLUE%^i%^WHITE%^tte%^CYAN%^r%^BLUE%^i%^WHITE%^ng %^CYAN%^sheen.  Around the edge, peculiar %^BLACK%^d%^WHITE%^i%^BLACK%^vo%^RESET%^t%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^s %^CYAN%^mar the half-oval shaped rim, their indentations as smooth as the interior.  On closer inspection, you realize that this is actually a breastplate fashioned from %^WHITE%^i%^CYAN%^c%^WHITE%^e%^CYAN%^.  The divots are where the arms and head go, while the half-oval design allows it to fit comfortably over the body.  Providing you can find a way to protect yourself from the cold, that is.%^RESET%^

The Gelugon, sometimes called ice devils, are fierce and horrible warriors feared by many.  Their weapons and armor are made of such cold ice that any contact with them can result in near fatal frostbite or worse.  Despite this, some are brave enough to fight such creatures, slaughtering them wherever they're found.  Such adventurers often report back that when the Gelugon's have melted, that their armor and weapons are left behind.  Bringing sheets of curved ice and spears of pure ice back as proof of their success.  A few researchers have suggested that these armors and weapons are in fact the exoskeletons of the creatures due to their horrific appearance.
