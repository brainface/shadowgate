%^RESET%^%^BLUE%^The material of this cloak glistens with a %^CYAN%^liquid %^BLUE%^like quality. Thinner than silk, the cloak is surprisingly sturdy and full, encompassing its wearer in an %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^inky blackness %^RESET%^%^BLUE%^highlighted by a cobweb of %^BOLD%^%^RED%^crimson %^RESET%^%^BLUE%^threads.  In motion, the cloak sweeps out behind its wearer in the dramatic display of a trailing %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^shadow%^RESET%^%^BLUE%^, while settled about the shoulders the cloak provides the %^RED%^%^BOLD%^disconcerting %^RESET%^%^BLUE%^sensation of being shrouded in living %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^darkness%^RESET%^%^BLUE%^. An enveloping hood can be drawn upward, further adding to this impression.  Curiously, there seems to be enough material within the hood's fold that a small item might be hidden there.%^RESET%^

The drow wizard Itl'ezakynt is credited with creating the Phantom Silk cloaks.  Through a disturbing ritual in which the very essence of a sentient being is siphoned from the still living host, a thread is created which can be woven only on a loom made from the enchanted bones of the dead host.  The weaving process takes over a month's time during which only one cloak is created.  That cloak is unique however as it imbues its wearer with some of the properties of the sacrificed creature.
