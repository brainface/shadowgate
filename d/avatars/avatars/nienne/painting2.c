"whose depths reveal hints of violet %^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^and darker shades of blue. Encircling her eyes are "

"%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^, her lips are invitingly full, and her fingernails are flawlessly painted a deep shade of "
"%^BLACK%^obsidian%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^.\n\n"

"%^RED%^ruby red%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^ lips a small smile rests. She contains no concerns about the robe, her bare "

"%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Behind her, flitting along the edges of the lighthouse a vast %^BLACK%^darkness%^BOLD%^"
