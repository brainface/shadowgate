Nimmi met this woman, Alysssa only after he had settled down, on the verge of retirement, after a successful, but confined life as an adventurer.  After a few years of the affair, Elishion found out, some suspect she knew from the beginning, but was not called by Li'Linmai to do anything for a few years.  Elishion killed Nimmi's mistress and on the eve of that day, gave Nimmi the head of his mistress as a present.  Some suspect she may have tried to kill him next, but she was never given the chance.  Nimmi went into a rage and killed her in a instant.  He tried all he could himself to bring back Alysssa in the preceeding moments and days, but could not. 

At the start of the next week he apparently informed his companions, nimmi begged them to help him, only three of them did so.  Nimmi and those three set out, with the head of Alysssa, to try to find a way to bring her back to life.  Of course, by this time the local clergy was after Nimmi and his companions.  They fled the town and headed north to some mountains.

I shall write more later
