%^BOLD%^Clothing by Kelsey, Tabor%^RESET%^
%^ORANGE%^This quaint shop is small, but well-cared-for.  It features a
few %^YELLOW%^homey touches%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^, namely small %^CYAN%^vases of flowers %^ORANGE%^and a few 
%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^hand-stitched pieces%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^.  Simple %^YELLOW%^forms %^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^are placed around the 
room, sporting finished items and products in the works.  Each 
item in the store is neatly folded and placed on %^YELLOW%^shelves%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^, with 
a few hanging for display.  It seems the owner tries to keep a 
variety of items and colors available along with making a 
sampling of different sizes.  A long %^RESET%^table %^ORANGE%^runs the length 
of the room, and it has been placed discreetly in the back 
to provide a work area with %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^scissors%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^, %^YELLOW%^threads%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^, and a variety 
of %^MAGENTA%^dyes%^ORANGE%^.  No stool is in sight, as it seems the owner must 
keep herself rather busy.

%^RESET%^<help shop> will show you a list of commands to use here.
