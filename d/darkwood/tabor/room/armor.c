%^CYAN%^This stone building features the fantastic craftsmanship of the

seamlessly.  Several suits of ornate %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^full plate armors %^RESET%^%^CYAN%^are displayed on

near the back of the room seems to be where the dwarven brothers 
conduct their business.  A doorway to the south is open, letting the

never seem to notice the heat.
