%^BOLD%^Cornelia's Crystal Creations, Tabor%^RESET%^
%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^This airy shop has a front made almost entirely 
of %^CYAN%^glass%^BLUE%^!  The floor-to-ceiling windows are covered in 
widely-spaced %^YELLOW%^sun-catchers %^BLUE%^that produce a %^BOLD%^%^RED%^r%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^a%^YELLOW%^i%^GREEN%^n%^CYAN%^b%^BLUE%^o%^RESET%^%^MAGENTA%^w %^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^of colors 
on the opposite wall.  %^CYAN%^Glass cases %^BLUE%^are spaced evenly around 
the walls, all holding some of Cornelia's most prized creations.  
Strangely, several bunches of %^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^dried herbs %^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^tied with %^MAGENTA%^colorful 
ribbons %^BLUE%^also hang from various places, providing an unusual,
though not distasteful, decoration.  A low %^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^wooden table %^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^sits 
in the back of the room, covering in small hammers, chisels, 
twine, and various other implements used in jewelling.  A short 
%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^stool %^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^stands just behind it.

%^RESET%^<help shop> will show you a list of commands to use here.
