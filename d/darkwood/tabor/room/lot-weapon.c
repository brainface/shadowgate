%^CYAN%^This stone building features the fantastic craftsmanship of the 
%^YELLOW%^dwarves%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^.  The walls are smooth and joined together almost 
seamlessly.  Beautiful %^MAGENTA%^mahogany racks %^CYAN%^stand around the room, supporting 
%^BOLD%^weapons %^RESET%^%^CYAN%^of all types.  Many of these are quite ornate and heavily carved, 
and it seems clear that these are more displays of craftsmanship than 
for sale.  The case near the %^ORANGE%^counter %^CYAN%^in the southern part of the room 
holds the weapons that are for sale.  A doorway to the west is open, 
letting the %^RED%^he%^YELLOW%^a%^RESET%^%^RED%^t %^CYAN%^of the %^RED%^forge %^CYAN%^into the shop.  The dwarven brothers, 
however, never seem to notice the heat.  

%^RESET%^<help shop> will show you a list of commands to use here.
