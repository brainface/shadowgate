"with them, sweeping the areas they pass though.  If cast without a target, the effect is centered on the room and "
"remains there.\n\nBy means of this spell, the wizard blocks all scrying attempts on him/her by means of scrying spells "
"like magic mirror, or scrying objects like a crystal ball.  The spell protects against scrying attempts based on the "
"level of the person attempting the scrying as opposed to the level of the caster with an intelligence adjustment. If the "
"level of the person scrying is high enough, the scryer 'burns through' the spell and the scry is successful.  A "
"successful 'burn through' does not end this spell, and it does not alert the protected person that it has been thwarted"
".  If the protection is successful, magical feedback interferes with the scrying magic and dispels it.\n\nA scry "
"detection spell, such as 'detect scrying' or certain magical items will detect a successful scrying attempt and thus, "
"can be used in addition to this spell to see if the scry protection has been thwarted. This spell can only be cast while "
