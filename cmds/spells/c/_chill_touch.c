       for any touch attack spell the following will likely work

       roll = BONUS_D->process_hit(caster, target, 1, bonus, 0, 1);
       roll will be a 0 for a miss, a -1 for a dice roll of 1 which is a miss
       a 20 for a dice roll of 20 or the actual dice roll

       if(roll == -1 || !roll) {
            ...set what happens when the touch attack fails
       }
       else {
           ... set what happens when it lands
       }
       ARGUMENT descriptions =
       caster = person casting spell
       target = target of the spell
       1 = the attack number they are using for the hit bonus - for players there is a -2 bonus when dual wielding, though this is
       negated if they have the feats - otherwise it is -2 x this number to a max of -10 (I know not how tabletop works) - technically
       could set this number at anything, though anything more than 5 will have the same impact as 5 or anything less than 1 will be counted as 1

       bonus = a bonus to hit or a weapon - if it's an integer it gets added as a bonus to hit - if it is an object it adds the enchantment to the hit bonus

       0 = the debug object if this is set to someone it will show the dice roll, attack bonus, and AC + Ac Bonuses

       1 = a flag that designates this as a touch attack - the real difference is that it does not include
       AC from equipment - only dodge bonuses/dex bonuses

       PLEASE NOTE: This spell now checks for deflection - see explaination below.

       Though beyond the scope of this spell - it is possible to allow a deflection attempt - so that they deflect
       with their shield or with something like concealing amorpha
       this would be as simple as "/daemon/combat_d.c"->extra_hit_calcs(caster, target, weapon, limb)
       at present weapon && limb have no impact and are not required - will likely remain optional
       as the code adapts
       the function call to extra_hit_calcs() will return 0 if the deflect is
       successful or 1 if it fails - in the event of a 0 it will
       also tell the caster and the target that the spell/attack was deflected
       so in this case if we wanted to allow for a deflection attempt also
       after the following check we do simply do
       if(!"/daemon/combat_d.c"->extra_hit_calcs(caster, target) {
       TO->remove();
          return;
       }

       both the caster, target, and room will be notified that it was a deflection or miss
       based on concealing amorpha - there is currently no seperating the two, it checks
       for both - this could also be easily modified to allow for a flag that specifics which to check for
                                    END SAIDE'S ATTEMPT AT EXPLAINING
