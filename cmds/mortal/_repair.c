%^CYAN%^SYNTAX%^RESET%^

repair OBJECT

%^CYAN%^DESCRIPTION%^RESET%^

Allows the repair of equipment based on the appropriate skill, ie. rings can be repaired by a jeweller, leather armor by a leatherworker, etc. Higher skill ranks will allow the repair of magical items, but failure at a skill check can damage the item in question. As a guideline, to effectively repair items intended for your level, we recommend splitting your points over no more than 1-2 crafting skills. However if you want to work on lower-level items, you could potentially split points over more than this.
