%^CYAN%^NAME%^RESET%^

name - heal something

%^CYAN%^SYNOPSIS%^RESET%^

heal %^ORANGE%^%^ULINE%^TARGET%^RESET%^

%^CYAN%^DESCRIPTION%^RESET%^

This will allow a player to tend to some of %^ORANGE%^%^ULINE%^TARGET%^RESET%^s wounds. The amount of healing and success depends on healing skill. Heal can't be used in combat and the process takes some time, during which you won't be able to move.

%^CYAN%^MONKS%^RESET%^

Monks of The Way of The Fist can use %^ORANGE%^<heal>%^RESET%^ in combat, and power of their heal won't depend on healing skill. Instead, it will be based on their monk levels and will always amount to monk levels multiplied by 8.
